<p>Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> found that people struggle to aggregate risk even
when provided with choice bracketing cues that could have built on an intuitive
sense of how aggregation reduces risk. The finding that people are more likely
to accept many gambles at once <span class="citation">(e.g., Samuelson, <a href="#ref-samuelson1963" role="doc-biblioref">1963</a>; Wedell &amp; Bockenholt, <a href="#ref-wedell1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span>, even without
any aids to calculate risk, suggests that people can gain an intuition for the
benefits of aggregation. Yet, in the current work, people instead considered
projects one at a time and only leveraged the benefits of aggregation when given
an explicit visualisation of what it entails.</p>
<p>This shows that it is important to change organisational policy to encourage
considering business projects jointly. Doing this means that the risk can be
concurrently aggregated. In real-life capital allocation scenarios, when
managers evaluate projects sequentially, an aggregated distribution can also be
presented using any number of projects that were considered in the recent past.
This means that a strategy of project risk aggregation can be implemented at any
stage in an organisation’s lifespan. Relatively new ventures can implement these
recommendations by waiting until a certain number of project proposals have been
accrued before aggregating.</p>
<p>Considering projects jointly is also useful for accountability purposes. The
usual incentive structure in organisations that judges each project outcome
independently is likely to punish risk-taking due to its potential negative
consequences and not due to the information that was available at the time of
evaluation. Framing a set of projects as a portfolio means that any subsequent
success or failure of one project can be traced back to the entire batch, and
the performance of the whole portfolio can be evaluated.</p>
<p>Business projects might not always be either accepted or rejected, as in
Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a>. Instead, top-level managers might ask for project
proposals from lower-level managers, and then allocate funds from the available
budget. An organisation might also have a initial “culling” phase, and a
subsequent ranking phase. When initially considering a set of projects, some
might be rejected according to certain rules. For instance, an NPV might not
meet a certain minimum cut-off. The remaining projects in the set can then be
ranked in order of priority and receive an allocation of capital from the
budget.</p>
<p>A few potential problems arise at the point that projects are considered jointly
for ranking and allocation. For instance, it might not be easy to compare
between the projects in the set. As discussed in Chapter <a href="introduction.html#introduction">1</a>,
diversification of business units has become very popular in large
organisations. Therefore, most hierarchical organisations are likely to face
difficult comparisons when deciding on how to rank and allocate capital to
projects that originated in different divisions. A non-hierarchical organisation
that develops one type of product may be able to simply compare across any
number of intrinsic project attributes, whereas a diversified organisation is
likely to have to rely on more abstract financial metrics, such as NPV. Such
metrics are “abstract” because they can be applied in almost any domain.</p>
<p>For instance, when comparing across two oil well projects, there can be both
attributes intrinsic to the project, such as the amount of hydrocarbons that are
extracted per hour, and also the more abstract financial metrics. There is a
potential interaction between the ease that managers have to compare across the
projects and the kinds of measures that are used to make the comparison. Two
similar projects, such as two oil wells can be evaluated using litres of
hydrocarbons extracted per hour, whereas an oil refinery cannot. In the case
that two dissimilar projects are compared, managers can use financial metrics to
compare across domains. This can lead to comparable accuracy as long as the
abstract metrics are as reliable as the intrinsic project features.</p>
<p>A concern that arises out of a reliance on such metrics is that underlying
variance is not taken into account. Forecast estimates such as NPV rely on many
assumptions and contain much inherent uncertainty, so managers that use them
should be cautious about over-relying on them. Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> tests
people’s sensitivity to forecast estimate variance information. That is, will
people use NPV more when the variance information suggests that it is a reliable
measure, than when the information suggests that it is unreliable?</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> manipulated project presentation and found no
significant difference between when projects were considered jointly or
separately. This was explained by the bounds on people’s ability to intuitively
aggregate. However, it was unclear what components of the projects people
focused on both because they were not explicitly manipulated and because the
task involved a binary choice (accept or reject). A relative allocation measure
for multiple projects with systematically varied attributes would allow to
determine the influence of those different attributes. Therefore,
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> considers the situation in which people are already
presented with choices together and asked to evaluate the projects by allocating
a hypothetical budget.</p>
<p>Further, Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> identifies the factors that affect people’s
decisions independently from the potential risk of losing hypothetical money,
which is a large reason for the effects in the previous chapter. Risk aversion
is accounted for by making it clear that no losses are possible. This is
achieved by using only positive NPVs, which implies that the project is not
forecasted to lose money.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> also manipulates how easy the project attributes are to
compare. This helps identify the ways that decision-making in a diversified
organisation may be different to that of a more integrated organisation.
Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> manipulated similarity by either showing a set of
projects from the same industry or a set from different industries. This was
meant to simulate an integrated and diversified firm, respectively. This
manipulation was not as strong because there were no project attributes that
could be aligned or not. That is, there was nothing actually non-alignable. This
may explain the equivocal similarity effect. In Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>,
alignability is more fully manipulated by having project attributes be critical
to the evaluation. These project features are shown explicitly so that the
difficulty of the comparison is more obvious.</p>
