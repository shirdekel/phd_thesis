% John commented this file extensively, so read through to see how to use the various options.  Remember that in LaTeX,
% any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.


%%%%% PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one formats for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
%\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{templates/ociamthesis}
% This one formats for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one formats for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper,nobind]{templates/ociamthesis}

% As you can see from the uncommented line below, oxforddown template uses the a4paper size, 
% and passes in the binding option from the YAML header in index.Rmd:
\documentclass[a4paper, nobind]{templates/ociamthesis}

%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
% Note that your bibliography will require some tweaking depending on your department, preferred format, etc.
% If you've not used LaTeX before, I recommend reading a little about biblatex/biber and getting started with it.

\begin{acknowledgements}
 	I am immensely grateful for my supervisors Dr Micah Goldwater, Professor Dan
  Lovallo, and Dr Bruce Burns. Micah was there for me from the initial struggles
  for an idea, to the stress of unexpected findings, to the last-minute questions
  about wording minutiae. Thank you for the spontaneous hallway conversations and
  for prioritising me when it was necessary. Dan's work and thought inspired much
  of the thesis experiments. Thank you for passing on valuable insights from your
  mentors, for challenging me, and for opening so many doors. Bruce's incisive
  feedback gave me confidence in the experiment development and subsequent
  writing. Thank you for the attention to detail and for our extended
  conversations.

  My family were critical to the thesis even before its inception. My parents were
  always a model for critical and creative thought and encouraged my curiosity.
  In a way, the PhD really began with my backyard inventions and experiments. I am
  also grateful for my sisters for our Friday nights jams and for allowing me to
  always have someone I can strive to impress.

  Thank you to everyone else who supported me. To Rachel, for the love,
  understanding, calls, runs, activities, and donut deliveries. To Nicky, Jacob,
  and Mich for being my second family throughout \emph{our} thesis. To Yoav and Josh
  for being my spiritual housemates and for tolerating their measly monthly quota.
  And to those who made an effort to read a portion of the thesis and contributed
  helpful insights (and to David for actually doing so).

  Two years ago, my coding knowledge consisted of what I learnt at the \emph{HTML
  Basics} class that I took when I was nine years old. Since then, I wrote the
  text of my thesis in Emacs and developed almost everything else as reproducible
  code. This would have not been possible without the support of the online \texttt{R}
  community on GitHub, Stack Exchange, and Twitter.

  Chapters~\ref{alignment},~\ref{interstitial-2}, and~\ref{anecdotes} of this
  thesis were edited by Elite Editing, and editorial intervention was restricted
  to Standards D and E of the Australian Standards for Editing Practice.

  Thank you all.

%%%%% SD PREFACE
\begin{preface}
 	\noindent \textbf{Naviating the document on a computer}

  There are links throughout the PDF document that facilitate navigation between
  cross-references. For most PDF viewers these links are identified by
  \textcolor{mylinkcolor}{dark blue} text. Otherwise, if you are using Adobe
  Acrobat you may instead have to look for the cursor to turn into a hand pointer
  (\faHandPointer[regular]). Clicking on these links will take you to the relevant
  hypothesis (e.g., Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:awareness-aggregation-1}),
  footnote,\footnote{Example of a footnote.} citation \autocite[e.g.,][]{kahneman1979}, figure (e.g.,
  Figure~\ref{fig:prospect-theory}), table (e.g.,
  Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-aggregation-1}), or section (e.g.,
  Chapter~\ref{introduction}) that they reference.

  If you are using Preview (on a Mac) then you can subsequently return back to
  where you clicked on the link by pressing the key combination \keys{\cmd + [}
  (the command key with the left square bracket). In Adobe Acrobat the key
  combination is \keys{\cmd + \arrowkeyleft} (the command key with the left arrow
  key) for Mac and \keys{\Altwin + \arrowkeyleft} (the Alt key with the left arrow
  key) for Windows.

  The sections of the thesis can also be navigated using the linked page numbers
  in the Contents section below. To display the Table of Contents as a sidebar in
  Preview go to \menu{View > Table of Contents} and then click \menu{Show} at the
  top right of the sidebar. Alternatively, you can use the key combination
  \keys{\Altmac + \cmd + 3} (the option and command keys with the number 3). To
  display the Table of Contents as a sidebar in Adobe Acrobat go to \menu{View >
  Show/Hide > Navigation panes > Bookmarks}.

  \noindent \textbf{Appendices}

  Many experiments were conducted throughout the development of this thesis.
  Further, each experiment included multiple measures and analyses, and not all of
  these were directly relevant for the thesis. Therefore, the main body of the
  text contains the content that was deemed most important, while three appendices
  contained the rest of the content. These appendices contain reports of
  supplementary experiments, experimental materials, additional measures, data
  simulations, power analyses, and extra explanatory material. The appendices are
  organised by the relevant empirical chapter:
  Appendix~\ref{aggregation-appendix} for Chapter~\ref{aggregation},
  Appendix~\ref{alignment-appendix} for Chapter~\ref{alignment}, and
  Appendix~\ref{anecdotes-appendix} for Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}.

%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{abstract}
	\noindent Capital allocation decisions are critical for large organisations.
 Management research mainly considers such decisions from an organisational
 perspective, largely overlooking potential psychological influences. Therefore,
 this thesis investigated cognitive processes that affect capital allocation
 decisions. Three studies examined how participants integrated multiple kinds of
 cues when making their decisions. Each study presented participants with both
 statistical information and non-numerical semantic information. In each study,
 participants had the opportunity to leverage a statistical concept that arguably
 should be the sole basis of the decision. The first study showed participants
 sequential risky choices without intermittent feedback. Participants could have
 combined the risk across decisions to reduce the overall potential loss.
 However, they struggled to do this unless it was depicted visually. The second
 study asked participants to allocate a budget across a set of business projects.
 Participants could have used the variance associated with the provided forecast
 estimates to choose which metrics to use for the allocation. However, they only
 appropriately used this information when it was expressed verbally and did not
 when it was expressed numerically. In the third study, participants saw projects
 with conflicting statistical and anecdotal evidence. The anecdotes were either
 similar or dissimilar to the target project. Participants could have clarified
 the conflicting evidence by using provided information about the distribution
 from which the anecdote was sampled. However, they ignored this information.
 Despite this, participants' use of the anecdote depended on its similarity to
 the target project. These results show that people's capital allocation
 decisions are bounded by a limited understanding of certain statistical
 concepts, but that they are capable of more nuanced choice when properly
 scaffolded.

\minitoc

Much of modern life depends on large organisations. General Electric (GE) makes
the engines that power our aircrafts, Johnson \& Johnson makes our shampoo, and
Google allows us to search the internet. The areas of our lives that are less
affected by such private firms depend on public sector organisations such as
public hospitals, schools, and police. The justification for the existence of
organisations of this size is that the particular combination of individual
divisions, alongside a corporate management, will lead to better performance for
each of the divisions than they would have been able to generate individually.
In other words, the assumption is that such organisations create a synergy---the
quality of the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts.

Multi-divisional organisations are typically organised in a hierarchical
structure, with a corporate management team and subsidiary divisions. Each
division can be made up of several business units. For instance, some of GE's
divisions include GE Aviation and GE Healthcare. Similarly, in the public
sector, a hospital system may operate through multiple individual hospitals in
different regions.

Such organisations therefore need to make capital allocation decisions. That is,
given a limited amount of financial resources, how best to invest in the
multiple divisions? Equally? Pick a winner? What metric should be used to
compare across divisions? Capital allocation is a critical process to the
operation and development of multi-divisional organisations.

The products and services that arise from organisations are necessarily a result
of the work of many people. In GE, for instance, the factories that generate
aircraft engines need to be staffed by production line workers, accountants are
needed for bookkeeping, and software engineers are needed to design and maintain
the production systems. Despite this, many important strategic decisions
ultimately come from a very small number of people. The decisions that the CEO
or other lower level executives make can have large consequences on the life of
the company.

It is often assumed that a few people having a lot of decision-making power is
for the best. Managers of large organisations often appear to be bold and
effective decision-makers. It appears that their position of power and wealth
was necessarily arrived at through high competence and rational decision-making,
suggesting that the organisation is in good hands. However, there are three
reasons why it may be concerning that much of an organisation's future---and by
extension often many more components of the economy---depends on the decisions
of a few individual. First, the role of survivorship bias in obtaining the
manager's role is unclear, because the number of managers that used the same
management strategy and failed is unknown. Second, decades of research has shown
that people's decision-making is often fallible and that job experience does not
always alleviate this fallibility. Third, managers of large organisations often
face uncertain environments, which increases the likelihood of managers facing
psychological biases.

There are many examples of companies that suffered due to such biases.
Overconfidence and confirmation bias likely played a part in Blockbuster's
famous refusal of an offer to buy Netflix in 2000 \autocite{meissner2015}. Further,
\textcite{roxburgh2003} identified how Equitable Life Assurance Society unnecessarily
anchored on previous interest rate performance and was unprepared when rates
changed. In an example of the sunk-cost fallacy, the London Stock Exchange
continued investing in an automated settlement system even when it no longer
remained profitable. The Bank of England needed to step in and stop the project.
Overconfidence in market entry is also a common issue, illustrated by EMI's
introduction into the medical-diagnostics market with the CT scanner \autocite{horn2005,camerer1999}. By underestimating the competition and overestimating their own
capabilities they eventually incurred losses and exited the market.

One class of biases has not been well studied: capital allocation biases. While
some previous work investigating these biases exists \autocite[e.g.,][]{bardolet2011}, many
questions still remain unanswered. This is a rather large hole in the literature
because capital allocation decisions are at the centre of executive and lower
level managers' roles. When making capital allocation decisions, there are
elements of the decision-making environment that can be deceiving for managers.
This thesis examines how the framing of a series of business projects affects
people's decisions about those projects. Specifically, the same set of projects,
presented in aggregate form, is much more likely to be accepted. Further,
sometimes people are distracted by extraneous semantic information, such as the
relative similarity of the options.

The results of the thesis show that although people in general make sensible
decisions, they fail to use critical information to inform their decisions.
Specifically, information about metric variance is ignored even when other
metrics are available. Further, people seem to appropriately use statistical and
anecdotal information based on relevance to the situation at hand, but ignore
information about the sampling of the anecdote. Not appropriately using these
kinds of statistical concepts has important financial consequences, discussed
below.

All the experiments in the thesis use laypeople, except for one experiment.
However, past work generally shows the same biases in managers and laypeople
\autocite[with some showing more bias in managers, e.g.,][]{haigh2005}. Further, upcoming
studies will directly test managers to determine any potential expertise
effects.

Section~\ref{capital-allocation} will explain how the capital allocation
process functions in hierarchical organisations and why it is necessary to
analyse such a process with a psychological approach. Section~\ref{psychology}
reviews the literature on decision-making biases and how these may apply to
capital allocation decisions. Section~\ref{chapter-overview} will then
summarise the rest of the thesis chapters.

\section{Capital Allocation in Hierarchical Organisations}\label{capital-allocation}}

The purpose of a multi-divisional organisation is to generate more value than
any of the individual divisions combined. The whole should be greater than the
sum of its parts. Previous work suggests that this is achieved due to factors
such as reduced transaction costs \autocite{williamson1981,teece1982,teece1980,coase1937,liebeskind2000}, shared resources \autocite{wernerfelt1984,barney1991},
increased competitive advantage \autocite{porter1980,porter1985}, increased monitoring
\autocite{gertner1994}, and increased synergies \autocite{barney1988}. The underlying logic is
the same: a multi-divisional organisation will be successful if it manages its
divisions using processes and resources that are shared or, better yet, are
complementary.

In order to successfully manage multiple units, large organisations developed a
hierarchical structure. \textcite{bower1970} identified three levels of the typical
management hierarchy: business, division, and corporate. These are equivalent to
front-line (or bottom), middle, and top level managers \autocite{noda1996}. Early
theorists suggested that the strategy for the organisation's growth is driven
completely by the top managers; the rest of the organisation simply enacts their
proposals. However, \textcite{mintzberg1985} emphasised the role of an emergent strategy,
in which lower level managers affect change in the organisation's strategy.
Other work proposed and found evidence for an iterated process in which a
strategic context may be set by top managers, but business projects advanced by
lower level managers also contribute to driving the strategy of the organisation
\autocite{noda1996,burgelman1983,bower1970}.

The way that capital is allocated in an organisation is very important to its
growth and longevity. This process is a part of the broader process of resource
allocation. A \emph{resource} can refer to many types of assets that an organisation
owns, both tangible and intangible, of which capital is only one
\autocite{wernerfelt1984}. The capital allocation process itself is an important driver
of the strategic outcomes of an organisation \autocite{bower1970,bower2005}, and as a
result, is an important influence on its financial performance \autocites[e.g.,][]{arrfelt2015,bardolet2010}. \textcite[p.~72]{sengul2019} describe intra-firm capital
allocation as ``(i) a process of determination, comparison, and selection among
multiple investment alternatives, (ii) taking place across organizational levels
of the firm, and (iii) influenced and constrained by the external context in
which the firm is situated.'' In capital allocation, business-level managers
typically formulate project proposals, which their division managers then
evaluate. The division managers then choose the projects to send for final
approval with the corporate managers. The supply of available capital is also
influenced by external sources such as investors, competitors, and customers.
However, this thesis focuses on the comparison and selection processes that are
relevant during business project evaluation.

Managers ultimately have only limited information about the projects that they
evaluate. They typically have access to descriptive information about the
investment and its known properties, but also are provided with financial
metrics that estimate the returns on the investment. There are many such
metrics; they usually attempt to encapsulate a trade-off between predicted
future gains, present losses (in the form of the capital spent to pay for the
investment), and opportunity costs. Examples include net present value (NPV),
internal rate of return, return on investment, cost-benefit, and pay-back
period. This thesis focuses on NPV, since it is one of the most frequently used
metrics for project evaluation \autocite{graham2001,remer1993,graham2015}. NPV is
the difference between the money that a project is forecasted to make and the
initial investment in its development (accounting for the time value of money),
as shown in Equation~\eqref{eq:npv}:

\begin{equation}
\text{NPV}=\sum_{t=0}^n \frac{R_t}{(1+i)^t}, \label{eq:npv}
\end{equation}

where \(t\) is the time of the cash flow, \(i\) is the discount rate, \(R_t\) is the
net cash flow, and \(n\) is the total number of periods. NPV is a useful metric
because simply knowing that it is positive suggests that the project that it
describes should be profitable. Therefore, metrics such as these have a strong
influence on the decision of the manager evaluating a project.

However, there are other influences on project evaluations other than the value
of the financial metrics. For instance, politics within or outside the company
can lead to situations in which a decision is based on social influence or even
manipulation \autocite{garbuio2017}. Such influence is not necessarily negative; it may
involve qualitative feedback from, for instance, a more senior manager
\autocite{thamhain2014}. Research has also shown that the media can have a tangible
influence on managerial decision-making \autocite{bednar2013,liu2013}. Other sources
of influence are the organisational structures and incentives that are in place
both externally \autocite{kokkinis2019} and internally to the organisation
\autocite{ullrich2004,rajan2000}. Such dynamics have also been the subject of economic
modelling investigations \autocite{reichelstein1997,cavagnac2005,ortner2017}.
Project proposals might also be affected by certain approval structures. For
instance, managers might submit overly-optimistic project proposals if they know
that the corporate team only accepts projects with a certain minimum NPV
forecast.

Another potential organisational influence on capital allocation is the extent
of diversification present in an organisation. A diversified organisation is one
that possesses different divisions that are unrelated in some way. \textcite[p.~96]{penrose2009} defined it as such:

\begin{quote}
a firm diversifies its productive activities whenever, without entirely
abandoning its old lines of product, it embarks upon the production of new
products, including intermediate products, which are sufficiently different
from the other products it produces to imply some significant difference in
the firm's production or distribution programmes.
\end{quote}

Previous work found that organisations that are made up of more related
divisions are more successful than those that are made up of unrelated divisions
\autocite{harrison1993,rumelt1974,shelton1988,wernerfelt1988}. This is also true
within business divisions \autocite{davis1992}. However, \emph{more} diversified firms have
also been shown to be associated with profitability \autocite{grant1988}. This is
usually explained by the ability for such firms to avoid risk associated with
any one market. Some of the discrepancy in diversification findings has been
explained to be due to the specific measures used \autocite{lubatkin1986}. It may also
be because most studies used Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes to
measure diversification \autocite[e.g.,][]{rumelt1974}, whereas others operationalised it
using other approaches \autocite[e.g., resource-based;][]{harrison1993}.

The advantage that related organisations have had has been explained through
\emph{synergies} \autocite{barney1988}. That is, an organisation with two divisions that can
use their resources to better one another are better off together than
separately. The 1960s saw a general rise in mergers and acquisitions from
executives seeking to diversify their organisations. However, doing so simply
for the sake of increasing divisions, rather than an understanding of the
possible synergies, leads to the organisation actually being worth less than the
sum of its parts \autocite[known as a \emph{diversification discount};][]{lang1994}. In fact,
many organisations that acquired other businesses to diversify subsequently end
up divesting them \autocite{porter1987}. For instance, in 2018 Australian conglomerate
Wesfarmers demerged its Coles division, a successful retailer. Since then, the
share price for both companies has risen by approximately 62\% and 32\%,
respectively \autocite{boyd2021}.

While much of the performance of an organisation depends on influences that are
external to the individual managers (e.g., organisational, political),
psychological factors are often also quite consequential. For instance, on the
one hand, organisational factors such as relevant support teams and approval
processes may influence capital allocation depending on the extent of an
organisation's extent of diversification. On the other hand, psychological
factors such as ability of managers to compare between business project
proposals may also impact allocation differently depending on the organisation's
diversification. It is likely to be more difficult for a manager to evaluate
project proposals from two dissimilar divisions that it is to evaluate those
from two similar divisions. The organisational influences discussed above often
assume that the manager that is making the decisions acts rationally, as per
traditional economic theory. However, surveys of executives show that CEOs and
CFOs often rely on non-financial factors for capital allocation decisions
\autocite{graham2015}. Executives in these surveys identified manager reputation and
confidence as two of the most important factors for capital allocation
decisions. Further, research in psychology has shown that cognitive biases can
influence such capital allocation decisions. Section~\ref{psychology} discusses
such biases and the relevant implications for the thesis.

\hypertarget{psychology}{%
\section{The Psychology of Capital Allocation}\label{psychology}}

Managers of large organisations are generally assumed to have a superior
decision-making capability compared with non-managers. However, managerial
decision-making involves many of the same processes that have been shown to be
affected by psychological biases in the general population \autocite{schwenk1984,das1999,mccray2002}. Further, an organisation's success ultimately depends on
strategic decisions made by top level managers \autocite{mazzolini1981}. Therefore,
despite early work attempting to analyse such decisions using a structured
organisational analysis \autocite[e.g.,][]{mintzberg1976}, it is important to understand
the potential influence of psychological biases on managerial decisions.
Research in the field of behavioural strategy has started to do this
\autocite{powell2011}.

Psychological research has shown that people tend to make decisions that are
inconsistent with neoclassical economic theory. For instance, expected utility
theory \autocites[EUT;][]{friedman1948,vonneumann1944} assumed that people have complete
information when making decisions. However, both laypeople and managers of
organisations are limited in the amount of information that they have and their
ability to use it \autocite{simon1955,cyert1956}. Such inconsistencies with economic
prescription are likely to have evolutionary origins, so are sure to be adaptive
in certain environments \autocite{haselton2009,gigerenzer2008,bettis2017}. However,
there are many situations in which such inconsistency with economic theory can
have bad consequences.

Research has shown many ways in which the allocation of capital in an
organisation can be influenced by psychological biases. For instance,
\textcite{benartzi2001} found that people tend to allocate their retirement fund equally
between the available options, regardless of their composition. This \emph{naive
diversification} bias was also found in capital allocation for hierarchical
firms \autocite{bardolet2011}. Managers allocated capital equally across the available
divisions in the firm, regardless of performance. Analysis of real companies
found that this behaviour is damaging to firm performance because it means that
lower performing business units get subsidised by higher performing units, which
are not operating at their full potential \autocite{arrfelt2015,bardolet2010}.
Subsequent studies found that business unit size also matters; capital
allocation to both the smallest and largest units is disproportionate to their
actual profitability levels \autocite{bardolet2017}. This was attributed to a
combination of naive diversification and political power effects.

Relatedly, people tend to continue expending capital into investments that
appear to be failing \autocite{staw1981}. This \emph{escalating commitment} is another way
that psychological biases can influence allocation in an organisation. This
pattern of decision-making is likely a consequence of the sunk cost fallacy, in
which people avoid ``cutting their losses'' even when they know that they cannot
recuperate an investment \autocite{parayre1995}.

Managers also do not always seem to seek profit maximisation. \textcite{shapira2014}
offered managers and Master of Business Administration (MBA) students two
investments from a hypothetical firm: one with the same expected returns as the
average of the firm's current investments and one with lower returns than the
firm's average returns. However, both investments were profitable, so to
maximise firm profits both should be chosen. Instead, participants were more
likely to only choose the first investment. It seems that the firm's average
returns served as an anchor, so participants did not want to reduce the firm's
average returns, regardless of profitability.

The way that information is presented can also influence allocations. For
instance, \textcite{yates1978} showed that people's evaluations are sensitive to the level
of detail in the information provided. They found that people devalued
descriptions of university courses more when they had less detail. This may be
relevant for managers evaluating project proposals. A proposal might appear more
attractive simply due to the level of detail in it, even if the level of detail
does not correspond with the quality of each proposal.

Further, people tend to be over-confident in their decisions and forecasts. This
has been shown in laypeople \autocite{langer1975,mannes2013,soll2004,puri2007}, as
well as in IT professionals \autocite{mckenzie2008} and managers \autocite{lovallo2003,kahneman1993,baroneadesi2013}. This is important for higher-level managers
that evaluate project proposals because the metrics that rely on forecast
estimates may be biased by the over-confidence of the lower-level manager that
created the proposal. Further, the higher-level manager evaluating the proposal
may in turn be over-confident about its prospects due to factors that are
unrelated to the underlying value. Overconfidence is also seen when considering
the success of projects in hindsight \autocite{bukszar1988,christensenszalanski1991}.
This means that it is less likely that managers will be able to effectively
learn from both past mistakes and successes due to the potentially erroneous
belief that the outcome was anticipated.

Managers often create sensitivity analyses, estimating the worst case, best
case, and most likely scenario for a forecast. However, these are likely to be
anchored on past experiences that further the manager's existing beliefs. In
fact, prior research has shown that people are poor at constructing subjective
probability distributions \autocites[e.g.,][]{alpert1982,schaefer1973,staelvonholstein1971,tversky1974}. Therefore, this suggests that even if the
lower-level managers that construct project proposals calibrate their forecasts
so that they are not over-confident, they are still likely to provide inaccurate
estimates of their degree of confidence.

The above summarises many of the currently known psychological biases related to
capital allocation. This thesis focuses on three essential processes within the
capital allocation process: (a) risky choice, (b) the comparison between
diversified businesses, and (c) the influence of prior experience. Each of these
is prone to separate biases, that are also interrelated. The subsequent
subsections review the literature for these processes.

\subsection{Risky Choice}

Neoclassical theories such as EUT suggest that when faced with multiple risky
options people should choose the option with the highest expected value (EV),
all else being equal. This means multiplying the value of each option by its
probability and comparing the resulting values \autocite[first documented in][]{pascal1999}. For instance, imagine being presented with the following two
choices:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi})}
\item
  a gamble that involves a 50\% chance gaining \$200 and a 50\% chance of losing
  \$100; or
\item
  gaining/losing nothing.
\end{enumerate}

In option A, the EV is calculated as \(200 \cdot 0.5 - 100 \cdot 0.5 = 50\). Since
the EV for option A (50) is higher than the EV for option B (0), EUT would
suggest that option A should be chosen.

This basic principle was extended by \textcite{bernoulli1954}, who suggested that a
person's subjective value of money differs depending on their current wealth.
This \emph{diminishing marginal utility} suggests that the more money a person
already has, the less value acquiring more money will have for him. For example,
the experience of a rich man that finds \$10 on the street is very different to
the experience of a homeless man that finds \$10 \autocite{bradley2013}. Even though \$10
was gained in both cases, \$10 has less value to a person that already has, for
example, \$1,000, than for a person that initially only has \$10. This principle
is usually modelled as an power function (with a fractional exponent).

Prospect theory \autocite{kahneman1979,tversky1992} challenged EUT by suggesting that
people's subjective value of money does not depend on their state of wealth---it
depends on a change of wealth from a reference point. This is important because
people's subjective value of money is different depending if they are gaining or
losing money. Specifically, losses have a stronger psychological impact than
equivalent gains. This disparity is one of the most settled and consistent
findings in psychology and economics, having been well-replicated \autocite[e.g,][]{ruggeri2020}. The fact that losses loom more than equivalent gains for the vast
majority of people is referred to as \emph{loss aversion} \autocite{kahneman1979}. This
finding was the primary reason that Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in
Economics in 2002 \autocite{kahneman2003}. Loss aversion has been found with small
amounts of money in experimental settings \autocite{kahneman1979,tversky1992} and with
millions of dollars in corporate settings \autocite{koller2012,swalm1966}. The effect
has been found in young children \autocite{harbaugh2001}, the numerous disparate
cultures in which it has been tested \autocite{weber1998}, and even in capuchin monkeys
\autocite{chen2006a}. Furthermore, a neural basis for loss aversion was identified
\autocite{tom2007}. Therefore, loss aversion is clearly central to human cognition and
behaviour.

The function that represents the value of a prospect describes both loss
aversion and diminishing marginal utility, as shown in
Equation~\eqref{eq:value-function}:

\begin{equation} v(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l} x^\alpha \text{ if } x \ge 0 \\
-\lambda(-x)^\beta \text{ if } x < 0, \label{eq:value-function} \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

where \(x\) is the possible outcome, \(\lambda\) represents the loss aversion
coefficient, and \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) represent the diminishing marginal utility
for gains and losses, respectively.

In other words, loss aversion means that losses have more impact than equivalent
gains. In fact, the impact of loss aversion can be expressed even more
precisely, as a measurement of the ratio of the slopes of the curve for gains
and losses. This measure tells us the average amount that losses have more
impact than equivalent gains. In a sequel to the original prospect theory paper,
\textcite{tversky1992} measured a median coefficient (\(\lambda\)) of 2.25 of loss aversion.
This means that people respond to losses 2.25 times more than equivalent gains.
Similarly, this paper measured a median exponent (representing diminishing
marginal utility, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)) of 0.88 for both gains and losses. This
means that people discount money the more of it they have by a rate of
\(x^{0.88}\).

Figure~\ref{fig:prospect-theory} shows loss aversion as the function being
steeper in the domain of losses than the domain of gains. It shows diminishing
marginal utility by the slight curve of the function. Equivalent changes in
actual wealth from the references point (x-axis) have different impacts on the
changes' subjective value (y-axis). An increase in wealth (\(x = 1\)) brings about
an equivalent increase of value (\(y = 1^{0.88} = 1\)). However, a decrease in the
same amount of wealth (\(x = -1\)) brings about a decrease in value 2.25 times the
value of the equivalent gain (\(y = -2.25 \cdot (-(-1))^{0.88} = -2.25\)).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/prospect-theory-1} \caption{An example of the value function in prospect theory.}\label{fig:prospect-theory}
\end{figure}

This research is relevant to capital allocation because the project proposals
that managers evaluate invariably involve an element of risk. Therefore,
managers are likely to be affected by similar effects on risk that have been
shown in laypeople. However, hierarchical organisations offer an even more
complex situation. \textcite{lovallo2020} found that the risk profiles of lower-level
managers are lower than those of the top managers. They suggest that this may be
due to lower-level managers' loss aversion to accepting projects that may
jeopardise their job. However, the top managers recognise that a loss in one or
more business units is likely to be offset by gains in other units. Such an
inconsistency in risk profiles across the levels of an hierarchical organisation
fails to take advantage of the benefits of risk aggregation, which has long been
understood in external markets \autocite{markowitz1952}.

\textcite{lovallo2020} suggested that lower-level managers' failure to aggregate risk to
the degree desired by top executives is costing companies approximately a third
of the total EV of new project proposals. This is an example of a negative
consequence associated with ignoring statistical concepts such as risk
aggregation. It is thus critical to identify ways to support risk aggregation
across organisational hierarchies. The psychological literature shows that
people's risk aggregation is facilitated through various choice bracketing
manipulations. However, there has been no work that investigated such situations
without providing participants with feedback in between decisions; this
critically limits the external validity of this work because in the real world,
organisations evaluate several projects before seeing the outcomes of any one
decision. The experiments presented in Chapter~\ref{aggregation} investigate
the effects of choice bracketing on risk aggregation without feedback.

\subsection{Project Similarity}

When evaluating project proposals, managers are likely to be influenced by the
relative similarity of the available options to each other. The extent to which
this may be true is important especially since the increase firm
diversification. Organisations are not only varied by the number of divisions
which they possess but also by the extent of diversification. This means that
managers are likely to find themselves comparing across dissimilar types of
projects.

As mentioned above, there are likely many organisational and financial reasons
why the extent of diversification in an organisation would impact its
performance. However, the impact of psychological factors has not been
investigated. Specifically, project similarity, which is an organisational
factor, is likely to affect the project comparison process, which is a
psychological factor. This may then have downstream consequences on firm
performance through, for instance, the kinds of financial metrics that are used
and how they are evaluated. Having more similar projects to compare may mean
more attributes on which to evaluate, whereas a dissimilar comparison may lead
to a situation in which a manager has to rely on potentially unreliable metrics.

Structure-mapping theory \autocite{gentner1997,gentner1983} provides a model of
comparison that psychologically distinguishes similar and dissimilar allocation
tasks. This framework models comparison as a process of bringing conceptual
structures into alignment which, when possible, puts shared dimensions into
correspondence. Alignment both highlights when two conceptual structures share
dimensions, but also highlights how the two structures differ along those shared
dimensions, called \emph{alignable differences}. For example, when comparing two oil
discovery projects, all the relevant processes of planning an exploration and
measuring the amount of hydrocarbons in a prospect might be identical, but the
specific amount measured will be different. This is the alignable difference: a
difference between the two projects that is constrained within the same
conceptual structure. However, when comparing between an oil field and a
refinery, there will be significantly more \emph{non-alignable differences}, because
the two domains do not share component dimensions. That is, many of the
processes that exist in the exploration business unit have a significantly
different dimensional structure to those in the refinery business unit, such
that it will be difficult to find meaningful alignments. More non-alignable
differences mean that there are less opportunities to make meaningful
comparisons, and so would make predicting relative project success and ranking
their priority more difficult. Chapter~\ref{alignment} experimentally examines
business project comparisons and how project alignment affects capital
allocation decisions.

When evaluating projects, managers make use of financial metrics, such as NPV.
However, such metrics are reliant on forecast estimates of, for instance, future
cash flows. Do managers take into account such inherent variance in their
decisions? This is especially important to investigate given the above
discussion. In cases of non-alignable comparison managers may rely on a
potentially unreliable metric. On the other hand, in an alignable comparison,
managers might have the option to based their decisions on the relative
reliability of different metrics. It is important to remember that all such
decisions are often very consequential for the manager. That is, the project
could ultimately make the company money and lead to future opportunities for the
manager, or potentially cause financial harm to the company (and subsequently
lead to a job loss). This is another example of the way in which ignoring
certain statistical concepts---here metric variance---can have negative
consequences for an organisation.

Psychological research shows that laypeople are in general quite poor at using
numerical variance information \autocite{galesic2010,konold1993,vivalt2021,batteux2020}. However, it is unclear to what extent managers would be sensitive
to variance information in the metrics associated with the projects that they
evaluate. On the one hand, perhaps managers' financial training will allow a
consideration of such variance estimates, but this might not manifest in a
situation in which managers have already been shown to be prone to biases.
Chapter~\ref{alignment} investigates whether participants are as sensitive to
verbally-instructed reliability information as they are to numerical reliability
information.

\subsection{Reasoning From Past Cases}

Managers often use past events to reason and make predictions about the future
\autocite{einhorn1987}. Such past events may be those that happened to the individual
manager, a case from the organisation's history, or from an external source.
This will especially be the case in a project evaluation scenario when a given
project is hard to compare with the other projects at hand. However, managers
evaluating project proposals may make inappropriate comparisons when considering
the target project to other cases. For instance, people tend to limit the size
of the comparison set to a small number. This is often only a handful of cases,
or even one. Doing this might mean only considering potentially irrelevant
surface similarity to the current situation and not aligning the underlying
causal structure. Further, this might mean not considering other similar
projects.

\textcite{tversky1974} discussed a number of biases that may influence such processes. The
availability bias is seen when people mistake the ease of retrieval of
information for its frequency. Further, research on analogical retrieval showed
that people are more likely to retrieve surface similar cases than those with a
relational connection \autocite{gentner1993}. As such, managers are likely to recall
cases that may not be sufficiently relevant to their target situation and be
overly-confident about the frequency of such cases occurring. Such a focus on a
particular case might then also lead to an anchoring effect, wherein other
decisions might be disproportionately seen as relevant. \textcite{tversky1974} also found
that people are not sensitive to properties of sample size such as the greater
amount of non-representative outcomes in small samples. This means that managers
are even less likely to appreciate the importance of considering a large sample
of cases when drawing conclusions to a target problem. \textcite{tversky1974} also note an
insensitivity to predictability, in which people do not take into account the
reliability of the information that they have to make a prediction. This might
mean that managers may struggle to ideally weigh evidence of varying degrees of
reliability.

External sources that may be used to compare to a target situation include
business case studies. Considering such examples of prior business decisions or
events are the way that most MBA students learn about the business world.
Publications such as Forbes or Harvard Business Review publicise various
businesses' successes and failures and so may create an allure to use such case
studies in the decision-making process. On the other hand, managers may have
access to more aggregated data about their industry from, for instance,
consultancy companies. How do managers use these various types of evidence in
their decision-making?

Research on this topic suggests that managers tend to prefer anecdotes over
statistics, unless aided \autocite{wainberg2018}. This is a concern because \textcite{gavetti2005}
suggests that managers often make use of case studies quite poorly. The analogy
literature draws a distinction between surface similarity, in which a mapping is
made between easily identifiable but potentially functionally irrelevant
attributes, and relational similarity, in which the underlying mechanism is
considered. Are managers sensitive to the deeper causal mechanisms that underlie
the anecdotes they judge? Or are they simply influenced by surface similarity?
Chapter~\ref{anecdotes} investigates the extent to which people use anecdotes
or aggregated data based on the relevance of the anecdote to the target project
during capital allocation. It also considers whether people are sensitive to
information about the distribution from which the anecdote was sampled. Ignoring
this statistical concept can have negative consequences for an organisation by
potentially over- or under-estimating the relevance of a past case and therefore
making an ill-informed investment.

\section{Chapter Overview}\label{chapter-overview}}

In sum, the potential consequences of a diversified hierarchical structure are
that business projects will be considered one at a time, and if they are
considered together, disparate project types will make comparisons hard.
Considering projects one by one might mean that risk is not aggregated across
projects and therefore value is lost. The difficulty to compare will lead to
both potentially relying on unreliable metrics, and relying on improper
anecdotal evidence. The thesis is that people often go half-way. They do not
completely disregard the normative strategy, but also struggle to use
statistical concepts such as aggregation, variance, and sampling.

The previous section identified three capital allocation processes that are
currently under-studied and so are important to investigate further. First, the
evaluation of individual project proposals may lead to managers only considering
such projects one at a time, despite the opportunity of aggregating a portfolio
of such projects. The choice bracketing literature suggests that there are ways
of facilitating such aggregation, but does not investigate this without
providing participants inter-trial feedback. Second, in situations in which
managers compare multiple projects, the structural alignment literature suggests
that managers in diversified firms will struggle to allocate capital, more than
those in more integrated firms. Further, these managers may not be sensitive to
the variance inherent in the financial metrics they rely on. Third, a difficulty
to compare across existing projects may instead mean a reliance on prior case
studies from personal or external experience. Research on anecdotal bias
suggests that managers may rely more on such case studies than on aggregated
data, but it is unclear whether their decisions will depend on anecdote
relevance. Further, it is unclear if they will appropriately use information
about the anecdote's sample distribution.

The rest of this thesis investigates the psychology of capital allocation
decisions in three chapters that describe empirical work, two theoretical
chapters, and a general discussion chapter. Chapter~\ref{aggregation} describes
two experiments that investigate the effects of choice bracketing on risk
aggregation without feedback. Chapter~\ref{interstitial-1} is a short
theoretical chapter that discusses the difference between evaluating project
proposals with inherent budget estimates and the process of allocating an
existing budget top-down. Chapter~\ref{alignment} describes three experiments
that investigate the effects of alignment and reliability type---verbal or
numerical---on allocations. Chapter~\ref{interstitial-2} is another short
theoretical chapter that discusses the trade-offs that people make when using
information to evaluate project proposal options. Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}
describes two experiments that investigate the effects of anecdote similarity on
the anecdotal bias. Finally, Chapter~\ref{discussion} discusses the theoretical
and practical implications of the empirical chapters and concludes the thesis.

\section{Introduction}

Investors know not to put all their eggs in one basket. Ever since work on
modern portfolio theory \autocite{markowitz1952}, it has been clear that combining the
risk of a set of individual investments reduces the overall risk of the
portfolio of investments. But what about situations in which it is not clear
that a set of investments fit together as a portfolio? Personal decisions such
as buying a car or moving cities are typically evaluated independently, as are
business decisions such as a farm investing in new cropping technology or a
multi-business firm building a mine.

While these decisions are separated in time, they are often not so far apart
that it is easy to learn from past outcomes (and sometimes the outcomes
themselves are unclear). This is because the outcomes of large investments are
often delayed. Therefore, the decision-maker cannot always use the knowledge of
the returns of one investment when evaluating a subsequent investment. Any
results that a farmer may identify from using a new technology will only become
apparent after many seasons of use. Similarly, it will take many years for a
multi-business firm to begin to estimate whether the output of a mine resulted
in the expected return on investment. These are the decisions that this chapter
investigates: sequences of large risky choices without immediate outcomes.

Risk aggregation is the combination of probability or variance information (or
both) associated with certain outcomes for the purpose of understanding that
information more comprehensively \autocite{bjornsen2019}. However, the psychological
literature suggests that this process may be difficult for people to use. Work
on prospect theory \autocite{kahneman1979} suggests that people's evaluation of gambles
does not conform to expected utility theory and is prone to framing effects.
Specifically, people typically evaluate gambles one by one \autocite{rabin2009,tversky1981,kahneman1993}. Therefore, it is unlikely that people will be able
to aggregate risk when they do not perceive a series of investments as a
portfolio. So, what would encourage people to aggregate risk? The literature on
\emph{choice bracketing} \autocite{read1999} shows that grouping a set of individual gambles
together facilitates risk aggregation. Therefore, the current work provides two
primary contributions. First, this work is the first to investigate the effect
of choice bracketing on risk aggregation in independent gambles evaluated
without immediate returns. Second, this work introduces novel choice bracketing
manipulations.

The earlier work on risk aggregation essentially did the aggregating work for
the participants. For example, experimenters provided participants with an
outcome probability distribution, usually with an explicit indication to group
the choices together, such as by asking for a single decision to be made on a
set of identical gambles. Other work addressed the more realistic situation of a
set of independent gambles. However, most of this work provided participants
with the outcomes of their choices before the subsequent choice. In these
paradigms participants experienced individual outcomes from the eventual outcome
distribution of the gambles, meaning that aggregation was confounded with
learning.

As mentioned above, in real life there is usually a significant delay between
the choice a person or firm makes and the outcome of that choice, and there are
likely to be several interim choices in the meantime. This is especially true
for business executives, who would typically have to wait months or years before
beginning to understand the consequences of their decision, and even then the
outcome may be unclear. However, previous work did not investigate the effect of
choice bracketing on risky choice without feedback. This is surprising, since
choice bracketing is exactly the kind of process that should promote aggregation
in these more realistic decisions. Therefore, this chapter investigated new ways
of encouraging participants to bracket their risky choices, but with a paradigm
that involves a series of independent choices without feedback. In this way, the
paradigm is more isometric with real-life risky choice.

\subsection{Multi-Play Gambles}

Despite the difficulties of risk aggregation, people seem to aggregate ``naively''
when considering multiple gambles. \textcite{samuelson1963} told of a colleague who
rejected a gamble that involved a 50\% chance of gaining \$200 and a 50\% of losing
\$100, despite the gamble's positive EV. That is, \(200 \cdot 0.5 - 100 \cdot 0.5 = 50\). Rejection of a positive EV gamble out of fear of the possible loss is
classic loss aversion. However, the same colleague said he would accept 100
plays of the same gamble. Samuelson argued that this choice is
irrational.\footnote{Other work suggests that it is consistent with expected utility
  theory, once certain assumptions are added \autocites[e.g.,][]{ross1999,aloysius2007}.
  However, a normative discussion is out of the scope of the present work.} Intuitively, it is clear that over the course of 100
gambles, the positive EV wins out, and a net loss of money is extremely
unlikely. Samuelson's colleague was more risk averse when making a single
decision about one gamble (a \emph{single-play} gamble), than when making a single
decision about multiple (in this case 100) identical gambles (a \emph{multi-play}
gamble).\footnote{This chapter uses the terminology for gamble types used in
  \textcite{bristow2011}, and \textcite{camilleri2013}.}

\textcite{wedell1994} replicated the \textcite{samuelson1963} anecdote experimentally with a gamble
involving a potential gain of \$100 and a potential loss of \$50. Participants
accepted the multi-play gamble of 100 plays more than the single-play gamble.
This effect has since been replicated with different outcomes and probabilities,
both with hypothetical and real money. Some participants often require fewer
than 10 plays of a previously rejected gamble in order to accept it \autocite{dekay2005,keren1991,montgomery1982,redelmeier1992}. Other similar studies found a
multi-play effect that was in the predicted direction but not significant
\autocite{barron2003,benartzi1999,klos2005,langer2001}. Further, the effect is not
seen when participants do not perceive gamble outcomes as fungible \autocite{dekay2006,dekay2005,dekay2011} or when choice is continuous rather than discrete
\autocite{bristow2011}.

However, multi-play effects are likely robust, since there is also evidence that
such gambles reduce a variety of cognitive biases. These include common-ratio
effects \autocite{keren1987,keren1991,dekay2006}, preference reversals
\autocite{wedell1990}, ambiguity aversion \autocite{liu2009}, and the illusion of control
\autocite{koehler1994}. Participants are also more likely to use explicitly provided EVs
in multi-play gambles \autocite{li2003}, show eye movements more congruent with an EV
model than single-play gambles \autocite{su2013}, and judge multi-play gambles as
riskier \autocite{joag1990}.

People prefer multi-play gambles that are displayed with an aggregated outcome
distribution of those gambles than those without \autocite{benartzi1999,redelmeier1992,klos2013,webb2017,coombs1971,venkatraman2006,dekay2005,langer2001,keren1991}. This is because these distributions
present the probabilities of all the different possible outcomes, so very
clearly show the rarity of a loss. Note that this does not seems to hold when
returns are calculated as percentages, rather than fixed dollar amounts
\autocite{stutzer2013}; and when participants do not perceive gamble outcomes as
fungible \autocite{dekay2005}. However, when this effect is demonstrated, the multi-play
gamble is usually set up such that its (binomial) outcome distribution shows a
relatively low chance of losing any money and a very low chance of losing a lot
of money. For instance, Figure~\ref{fig:samuelson-distribution-10} shows the
outcome distribution of the \textcite{samuelson1963} gamble played 10 times. Outcome
distributions of this sort do the aggregating work for the participants, making
the attractiveness of the multi-play gamble clearer. This work suggests that
participants can comprehend and respond to aggregated risk, but that they
struggle to compute the aggregation without external help.

Green bars represent gains and red bars represent losses.}\label{fig:samuelson-distribution-10}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Repeated-Play Gambles}

Decisions in real life are usually sequential and rarely identical as in the
multi-play paradigm \autocite[cf.][]{barron2003}. That is, people tend to be confronted
with individual choices whose outcomes and outcome probabilities are different
from one choice to another and these choices occur at different points in time.
In a business setting this can be seen in decisions about whether to invest in
new projects; proposals and opportunities differ widely and occur at different
times. Managers are never simply asked: ``here are 10 identical investments to
consider; do you want all or none of them?''

In \emph{repeated-play} (rather than multi-play) gamble paradigms, participants make
decisions about a series of individual gambles. Research using this paradigm
found that people are less risk averse both when outcomes for a series of
gambles are evaluated less frequently and the subsequent decisions are made less
frequently \autocite{gneezy1997,thaler1997,bellemare2005,beshears2016}. People are
also less risk averse (for positive EV gambles) when they receive feedback after
each decision or are able to sample from the distribution of possible outcomes
before making a choice \autocite{camilleri2011,camilleri2013,barron2003,wulff2018,ludvig2011,hertwig2004,jessup2008}. Other work found that loss aversion is
mitigated when people are explicitly instructed to consider the options as a
part of a portfolio \autocite{sokolhessner2009,sokolhessner2012}.

These studies are closer to real-life decisions than the multi-play gamble
paradigm because they involve a set of separate gamble decisions rather than a
single decision about a set of gambles. However, for the most part, the
experiments used in the repeated-play gamble literature use various forms of
feedback throughout the course of the experiment. That is, participants are
shown the outcomes of their gambles before they make more decisions. This
paradigm is known as \emph{experience-based choice}. In \emph{description-based choice},
on the other hand, the gamble is simply presented to the participant without any
feedback, as in the multi-play gambles above. In real life, people rarely see
the immediate outcomes of their risky choices, and even less so in business
settings, where any return on investment often takes years to manifest.

Only a limited number of studies have used a repeated-play paradigm without
feedback. For instance, \textcite{jessup2008} and \textcite{hertwig2004} investigated the effects of
feedback in repeated-play gambles on the weighting of small probabilities, and
had a no-feedback control condition. Other work similarly used individual
description-based gambles presented sequentially \autocites[e.g.,][]{ert2013,joag1990}.
However, these studies did not attempt to facilitate participants' risk
aggregation. \textcite{haisley2008} provided limited evidence for facilitating risk
aggregation. They gave participants the opportunity to buy five (negative EV)
lottery tickets, and either presented them one at a time, or together.
Participants bought fewer tickets, when they considered them jointly, thereby
maximising EV. However, the experimenters did not specify the outcomes and
probabilities of each gamble, meaning that it is unclear if participants
understood the independent lotteries as identical or non-identical. This reduces
the external validity of the study, as most independent risky choice involves
non-identical outcomes and probabilities. In sum, these studies were not
designed to research how to facilitate risk aggregation and reduce loss
aversion. The experiments in this chapter are novel because their goal is to
facilitate risk aggregation without the experimental artefact of immediate
feedback.

\subsection{Choice Bracketing}

Research in psychology and economics has identified ways of facilitating risk
aggregation by encouraging people to group their choices. Specifically, people
aggregate more when they consider the consequences of their choices together
(broad bracketing) than when they consider them individually \autocite[narrow
bracketing;][]{read1999}. In multi-play gambles (especially when displayed with
an outcome distribution), choices are inherently bracketed broadly because a
single choice is made about multiple gambles. Similarly, studies that used
repeated-play gambles facilitated risk-tolerance through what can in hindsight
be considered broad bracketing. For instance, when \textcite{thaler1997} presented gamble
outcomes less frequently, they allowed participants to consider longer time
increments with a single evaluation.

Both the original \textcite{samuelson1963} anecdote and its subsequent replications show
that people do have an intuition for aggregation even without the risk being
calculated exactly for them. This chapter tests whether that same intuition can
be elicited and applied across sets of unique bets. What are the minimal
conditions required to encourage aggregation? The multi-play gamble work
suggests that participants can engage in a more intuitive form of aggregation
when provided with the right contextual cues. Investigating the effects of more
subtle cues will help shed light on the cognitive processes underlying choice
bracketing. Of course, the effects of more subtle cues would not eliminate the
utility of explicit financial education, but they will help the design of
decision-making contexts to best align with such instruction.

One way of potentially facilitating risk aggregation is to highlight to
participants the number of total options that are available to them.
\textcite{sokolhessner2009} and \textcite{sokolhessner2012} reduced risk aversion using lengthy
instructions that encouraged participants to ``think like a trader.'' This meant
considering all the repeated-play gambles as a portfolio, as opposed to
considering them individually. However, this was quite a strong manipulation
that is perhaps unrealistic in real world. A more subtle cue could involve
simply making participants aware that they are going to be making a series of
choices. If people possess an intuitive understanding of aggregation, as
suggested above, then this kind of contextual cue will also facilitate
aggregation.

In addition to simply informing participants that they will make a series of
choices, making the choices more readily comparable may facilitate broad
bracketing, and thus risk aggregation. Consider the inverse situation wherein a
lack of comparability between choices may prevent broad bracketing, such as when
an executive for a multi-business firm makes decisions across multiple distinct
industries. Of course, the similarity of decision contexts does not change the
maths of risk aggregation, but may well affect whether people do aggregate risk
across decisions. \textcite{dekay2005} found that multi-play effects are not seen when
choices are not considered fungible. For instance, participants aggregated
across dollar amounts, but not across patients in a medical decision. Therefore,
people may behave similarly when considering a set of dissimilar choices if they
do not consider them fungible.

There is further suggestive evidence that the similarity of a set of choices to
one another will affect choice bracketing. Choices whose differences are easy to
compare (alignable differences) are weighted heavier than those that are
difficult to compare \autocite{markman1995,markman2010}. Increased similarity across a
set of choices may both highlight the ability for those choices to be bracketed,
and further facilitate risk aggregation through the comparable attributes.
However, it is possible that increased similarity will facilitate risk
aggregation even without a tangible benefit to the underlying calculations. That
is, it is possible that simply manipulating the similarity of
financially-irrelevant semantics of a choice set will make people less risk
averse. If so, then this will be by virtue of an implicit risk aggregation in
which the mere awareness of the possibility of a grouping of choices reduces
risk aversion. It is important to investigate the effect of similarity
especially because in managerial settings, executives in multi-business firms
will often have to make comparisons across industries that are hard to compare.
For instance, GE currently develops both analytic software products and jet
engines for the military. They had been even more diversified previously, at one
stage simultaneously developing home appliances and owning the NBC television
network.

In addition to the similarity between choices, how choices are presented may
affect how easily they are compared, and thus whether or not the multiple
subsequent effects listed above would come to fruition. As mentioned above,
\textcite{haisley2008} found a higher degree of EV maximisation when gambles were
presented jointly, rather than separately. Similarly, \textcite{hsee1999} found that
people's choices were affected by whether they viewed the attributes of the
choices separately or jointly. Their \emph{evaluability hypothesis} suggests that
attributes that are difficult to evaluate will have a greater impact on joint
presentation than separate presentation. Joint presentation is a form of broad
bracketing because it forces a participant to view of all the components of a
decision together. Participants may therefore be more likely to consider
aggregating the risk involved in a set of choices when all those choices are in
view. Joint presentation potentially reduces the working memory load otherwise
needed to maintain that set of choices. Therefore, it is quite possible that a
combination of highly similar choices, presented jointly will lead to the
highest likelihood of broad bracketing, and thus risk aggregation.

\textcite{moher2010} replicated \textcite{gneezy1997}, but separately manipulated the number of
gambles seen per trial and feedback frequency. They found that participants were
less risk averse when viewing a set of three gambles per trial, than when
viewing only one. However, they only found this effect with a set of identical
outcomes. When outcomes were non-identical, there was no effect of presentation.
However, participants were always presented with gamble outcomes for each trial,
so it is unclear to what extent this influenced participants' ability to bracket
broadly. In fact, when seeing gambles separately, participants were less risk
averse when receiving feedback for each trial, compared to every three trials.
Testing a presentation manipulation without the confound of feedback will help
to clarify this effect.

\subsection{Internal Capital Market Investment Context}

Executives of large, successful firms are often viewed as fearless risk-takers
who take on risky projects to generate innovation and growth. However, the
available evidence suggests that executives do not view themselves that way
\autocite{swalm1966,march1987}. Executives typically evaluate multiple investments
over time. Risk aggregation is sensible when investments are only partially
correlated (i.e., the success of one does not influence the success of another).
It is sensible to take on a set of risky investments with positive EV, where
each investment has some chance of loss, because those that succeed will make up
for those that failed. These benefits are well-known in stock market investment
settings, thanks to Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz's work on modern portfolio
theory \autocite*{markowitz1952}.

However, it is unclear whether the general public and even business managers use
this concept, due to the extent of risk aversion in both those populations
\autocites[e.g.,][]{tversky1992,march1987}. In fact, executives treat risk like the rest
of us; they view investments one at a time, are risk averse in the domain of
gains, and are risk seeking in the domain of losses \autocite{maccrimmon1986,swalm1966,lovallo2020}. However, it is understandable why risk aggregation is
foreign to most people; outside of an investment portfolio selection situation,
it is unlikely for people to spontaneously group a selection of individual risky
choices. Usually in life, people encounter risky choices sequentially, and so
the risk of each individual choice is more salient than the aggregated risk of
an arbitrary combination of choices.

\textcite{lovallo2020} showed that executives treat investments within their own company
in isolation. In multi-business firms, the managers of each business unit often
make the investment decisions about individual projects. Therefore, they often
do not consider the scope of their decisions in the context of the entire
company. For instance, Nobel laureate Richard Thaler offered 25 division
managers working for the same firm a hypothetical investment that involves a 50\%
chance of gaining \$2 million for the company and a 50\% chance of losing \$1
million \autocite*{thaler1999}. Only three managers said they would accept the
investment. However, the CEO indicated that he would have clearly preferred
managers to accept all the investments. To each middle-manager, the choice
represents a risk of loss for their division and potentially their job, whereas
for the CEO the entire portfolio of choices represents a worthwhile risk.

This chapter investigates risky choice in the context of business project
investment internal to a company because this is a real-world context where
choice bracketing is important and currently under-appreciated \autocite{lovallo2020}.
The participants in these experiments were taken from a population that does not
have extensive managerial experience. However, in such a population a lack of
risk aggregation is most likely more common, and the variables used here are
readily applicable to the financial decisions that laypeople make. For instance,
one of the real-world applications of the choice bracketing literature has been
to use outcome distributions and increased time horizons to encourage investment
in high risk, but high EV, retirement funds \autocite[e.g.,][]{benartzi1999}. Otherwise,
people typically prefer low risk, low EV, funds. Further, using laypeople
eliminates potential differences in prior experience with the management-based
decision-context. Upcoming research will focus on managers with context-specific
experience to investigate the effects of that experience.

\hypertarget{aggregation-1}{%
\section{Experiment~1}\label{aggregation-1}}

Experiment~1 investigated the effect of three choice bracketing manipulations on
risky choice in hypothetical capital allocation scenarios. Previous research
had low ecological validity because of the use of multi-play paradigms or
feedback. In this experiment, the risky choice task was a description-based
repeated-play paradigm. This means that participants had to make a choice about
whether to accept a number of different hypothetical investments, but were not
provided with the outcome of their choices after each decision. The variables of
interest were the similarity of the choices, whether the choices were presented
together or separately, and whether participants were aware of the number of
choices that they would be making.

The values and probabilities of the gambles were set up such that each
individual gamble, as well as the aggregation of all the gambles, would be
attractive to a rational agent interested in maximising EV. As such, the key
dependent measure was the proportion of risky choices participants accepted.

Previous research suggests that people will be willing to make more risky
choices when explicitly told to bracket their choices \autocite{sokolhessner2009,sokolhessner2012}. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[awareness main effect]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:awareness-aggregation-1}{}{\label{hyp:awareness-aggregation-1} \iffalse (awareness main effect) \fi{} }Participants that know how many projects to expect will make more risky choices
than participants that are unaware.
\end{hypothesis}

Further, previous work suggests that joint presentation is a form of broad
bracketing \autocites[e.g.,][]{moher2010,hsee1999}. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the
following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[presentation main effect]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:presentation-aggregation-1}{}{\label{hyp:presentation-aggregation-1} \iffalse (presentation main effect) \fi{} }Participants will make more risky choices when seeing projects jointly than when
seeing them separately.
\end{hypothesis}

Similarity of options has also been shown to affect the way people bracket their
choices \autocite[e.g.,][]{dekay2005}. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[similarity main effect]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:similarity-aggregation-1}{}{\label{hyp:similarity-aggregation-1} \iffalse (similarity main effect) \fi{} }Participants that see projects from the same industry will make more risky
choices than participants that see projects from different industries.
\end{hypothesis}

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

One hundred and ninety-eight participants (82 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 32.52 years (\emph{SD} = 11.42, \emph{min.} = 18, \emph{max.} = 69). Participants reported an average of 7.01 years (\emph{SD} = 9.1, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 42) working in a business setting, and an average of 1.7 years (\emph{SD} = 2.85, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 20) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 12.04 min (\emph{SD} = 11.29, \emph{min.} = 3.1, \emph{max.} = 112.4).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-aggregation-1}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\hypertarget{instructions-materials-aggregation-1}{%
\paragraph{Instructions}\label{instructions-materials-aggregation-1}}

Participants were told to imagine that they are executives in a large company
and that they will need to decide about investing in a number of hypothetical
business projects. The appendix shows these instructions in
Figure~\ref{fig:instructions-materials-aggregation-1}.

\hypertarget{task-aggregation-1}{%
\paragraph{Risky Investment Task}\label{task-aggregation-1}}

Participants saw 10 short descriptions of business projects, and were asked
whether they would invest in that project or not. Each description included the
name of the hypothetical business, the amount they forecast the project to cost,
the amount the project is forecast to make, and probabilities for these
forecasts. The project values were selected so that the projects appeared
attractive when aggregated, and unattractive when segregated \autocite[see][]{langer2001}.
These values were different for each project, but followed a set of constraints
for each project's EV and the probability of any loss given the outcome
distribution of all 10 projects (\(P(\text{loss}_{aggregated})\)). Further, there
was a constraint on the gambles' loss aversion coefficient (\(\lambda\)), which is
a measure of people's sensitivity to losses compared to gains. The constraints
were:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\text{EV} > 0\);
\item
  \(\lambda < 2.25\); and
\item
  \(P(\text{loss}_{aggregated}) < 0.1\).
\end{enumerate}

As such, each project cannot be considered to be a loss in terms of expected
value, but also would not be an easy choice for investment, because of the low
\(\lambda\) \autocite[made to be lower than the median loss aversion coefficient calculated
in][]{tversky1992}. Further, since people are especially sensitive to loss
probabilities \autocite{zeisberger2020,kahneman1979}, an arbitrarily low
\(P(\text{loss}_{aggregated})\) was chosen to make investment in the complete set
of projects seem attractive. The actual probability of a loss given the outcome
distribution used in the experiment was 0.09.
This was calculated by summing all probabilities in the Poisson binomial
distribution whose outcomes were less than zero. For comparison,
\(P(\text{loss}_{aggregated})\) = 0.17
for 10 plays of the \textcite{samuelson1963} gamble. The highest probability of a loss for
any single gamble (\(P(\text{loss}_{single})\)) was
0.80.
Figure~\ref{fig:project-choice-aggregation-1} shows an example of a description
of a project in this task.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/project-choice-aggregation-1-1} \caption{Example of a project choice display in Experiment~1.}\label{fig:project-choice-aggregation-1}
\end{figure}

In the high similarity condition, these project descriptions were all about one
type of project (in this case an oil well project) and were all from the same
business. In the low similarity condition, each project was from a different
industry. In the joint presentation condition, the 10 projects were all
displayed on the one webpage, whereas in the separate presentation condition
each was displayed on a different webpage. Participants in the aware condition
saw the display shown in Figure~\ref{fig:awareness-aware-aggregation-1} before
their separate presentation display. Those in the naive condition simply
proceeded without this message. The financial and probability values were
identical regardless of condition, and the order of each set of 10 projects was
randomised.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/awareness-aware-aggregation-1-1} \caption{The display seen by those in the aware condition of Experiment~1.}\label{fig:awareness-aware-aggregation-1}
\end{figure}

Although the project descriptions were succinct, and the decisions in the task
were made quickly, they reflect real decisions in businesses in critical ways.
Companies that consider their forecast estimates probabilistically (i.e., do not
simply use the most likely estimate as the only estimate) do frame their options
as likelihoods of certain monetary outcomes.

\hypertarget{outcome-distribution-materials-aggregation-1}{%
\paragraph{Outcome Distribution Decision}\label{outcome-distribution-materials-aggregation-1}}

Participants were asked if they would invest in the last 10 projects they saw
and were provided with a graph of the outcome probability distribution of the 10
projects. Figure~\ref{fig:project-choice-aggregated-aggregation-1} shows this
graph. A coding error was discovered after collecting data. This was an error in
the generation of gambles, which meant that the outcome distribution decision
data could not be used. Therefore, the effect of outcome distribution will not
be discussed until Experiment~2, which fixed this issue.
Appendix~\ref{outcome-distribution-aggregation-1} presents an analysis of these
data, and describes the coding error and its implications.

\paragraph{Follow-up Gambles}

Participants were shown four further sets of gambles (11 total) that checked
participant attention and replicated the gambles from \textcite{samuelson1963} and
\textcite{redelmeier1992}. See Appendix~\ref{follow-up-materials-aggregation-1-appendix}
for details.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants read the instructions and completed the risky investment task,
first in the separate presentation condition, and then in the joint condition.
They then made the outcome distribution decision and responded to the 11
follow-up gambles.

\hypertarget{results-aggregation-1}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-aggregation-1}}

\subsubsection{Project Choice}

A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to investigate the
effects of similarity, awareness, and presentation on the proportion of
participants' decision to invest in the 10 projects. As seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-1-awareness}, participants invested more when
they were told that there will be 10 projects, compared with when they were not
told this, \(F(1, 194) = 9.52\), \(p = .002\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .047\). As seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-1-presentation}, participants invested more
when viewing the projects jointly, compared with when they viewed them separately,
\(F(1, 194) = 28.14\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .127\). Although there was no main effect of
similarity, \(F(1, 194) = 1.63\), \(p = .204\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .008\), the interaction between
similarity and presentation was significant,
\(F(1, 194) = 4.31\), \(p = .039\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .022\) (see
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-1-similarity-presentation}). Specifically, the
presentation effect was stronger in the high similarity condition,
\(\Delta M = 0.07\), 95\% CI \([0.04,~0.09]\), \(t(194) = 5.29\), \(p < .001\), than in the low similarity
condition, \(\Delta M = 0.03\), 95\% CI \([0.00,~0.05]\), \(t(194) = 2.06\), \(p = .041\). These findings
suggest that it is possible to facilitate risk aggregation with subtle choice
bracketing manipulations.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Trial-by-Trial Analysis}

Exploratory analyses were conducted into the possible effects of the
manipulations on a trial-by trial basis.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-1-trials} shows the data for all conditions.
However, the key findings are in the separate presentation. As
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-1-trials-separate-awareness} shows, in the
separate condition people are more likely to accept projects over the 10 trials,
but this interacts with awareness,
\(b = 0.04\), 95\% CI \([0.01, 0.08]\), \(z = 2.32\), \(p = .021\).
Specifically, the relationship between choice and trial is stronger in the aware
condition,
\(b = 0.11\), 95\% CI \([0.06, 0.16]\), \(z = 4.54\), \(p < .001\), than in the
naive condition,
\(b = 0.03\), 95\% CI \([-0.03, 0.08]\), \(z = 1.01\), \(p = .311\). It seems that
participants that were told the total number of projects became less risk averse
as the experiment proceeded, regardless of the gamble values.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{discussion-aggregation-1}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-aggregation-1}}

Experiment~1 found evidence for most of the hypotheses. Specifically, people
made more risky choices when considering those choices jointly on the same page,
compared to on separate pages; and when they knew how many choices were in the
set. Further, the results showed an interaction between project similarity and
presentation. Exploratory analyses showed that participants' risk aversion
decreased as they proceeded through the trials, but only when participants were
aware of the number of projects.

\subsubsection{Presentation Effect}

The presentation effect may be a result of one of two mechanisms. A mathematical
aggregation explanation would mean that participants are combining the gambles
into a mental representation of the probability distribution and then deciding
based on the attractiveness of that distribution. A joint presentation of
choices would facilitate this combination. On the other hand, people may also be
using a sort of naive aggregation process when they are encouraged to group
their choices together. A naive aggregation explanation would suggest that
participants in the joint condition are simply more likely to realise that a few
big wins could offset a few losses. Participants could have been encouraged by
the joint display to consider the set of projects together. This could then lead
to the conclusion that investing in a higher number of gambles might mean that
the gains of some projects will pay off the losses of the other projects.

\subsubsection{Awareness Effect}

Experiment~1 found that participants that viewed the projects separately were
more likely to invest in the projects as the trials went on, regardless of the
actual gambles. Having an awareness of the total number of projects in the set
could increase the likelihood that participants would naively aggregate.
Specifically, knowing the number of total projects might increase the salience
of the idea that the gains of some projects will offset the losses of others,
because it reinforces a focus on the entire set. Another possibility is that
participants had a certain aspiration level \autocite{lopes1996} that they were
attempting to reach. This might mean that they invested more as the task
proceeded after realising that the gambles were not becoming significantly more
favourable. \textcite[p.~219]{barron2003} specifically did not tell participants about
the number of gambles they would experience to ``avoid an `end of task' effect
(e.g., a change in risk attitude).'' \textcite{barron2003} provided participants with
feedback, but this should not be necessary for an aspiration level explanation
since participants only need to be aware of the potential for certain gains.

This result may also be due to a Gambler's fallacy effect or the law of small
numbers. This effect is characterised by people's expectation of a pattern to
follow the underlying distribution of the function that generates each
component. For instance, someone observing the results of a coin flip that look
like HTTHTTTT might anticipate that the likelihood of ``heads'' is higher than
that of ``tails,'' despite the actual likelihood being 50\% for either. This effect
occurs in sequential decision-making, so may be relevant for the repeated-play
decisions in Experiment~1. \textcite{barron2010} found that the gambler's fallacy (in a
roulette prediction task) emerges when information about past outcomes was
displayed sequentially, but not when it is displayed all at once. \textcite{haisley2008}
found evidence for the gambler's fallacy with a repeated-play gamble paradigm.
As such, it is possible that an effect such as the Gambler's fallacy can explain
the effect of the awareness manipulation. That is, participants may have thought
that after a few gambles that they considered risky, the last ones were more
likely to materialise. Further, this would be more likely to occur for those
that knew the total number of projects, because they knew when the sequence was
approaching its end.

\hypertarget{similarity-discussion-aggregation-1}{%
\subsubsection{Similarity Effect}\label{similarity-discussion-aggregation-1}}

Experiment~1 did not find a main effect of similarity in the individual choice
data as predicted in Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:similarity-aggregation-1}. Instead,
choice similarity interacted with the presentation condition. This interaction
is harder to explain since it was not hypothesised. In fact, the results seem to
suggest the opposite to what was originally expected. Initially, it was
predicted that people would be less risk averse in the high similarity
condition, due to the better ability to consider the isolated projects as a
grouped set. Similarity was thought to act as a broad bracket, and therefore
increase aggregation. That is, it was expected that seeing a set of similar
projects would help participants aggregate risk when seeing them separately,
more than when projects are dissimilar. Instead, project acceptance was actually
numerically higher in the low than in the high similarity condition
(\(\Delta M = -0.06\), 95\% CI \([-0.12,~0.00]\), \(t(228.14) = -1.83\), \(p = .068\)) when projects were
presented separately, averaging over awareness conditions.

There was no significant difference between similarity conditions regardless of
presentation condition. However, allocations were significantly higher in the
joint presentation condition than in the separate condition for both high and
low similarity. The interaction seems to have been found due to the larger
difference in the high similarity condition. Perhaps the ability to aggregate
risk when projects are presented together is more made more salient when
projects are similar.

Specifically, the interaction seems to be driven by the separate high similarity
condition being lower, rather than by the joint high similarity being higher, as
would have been expected. As such, participants could have been engaged in a
naive \emph{diversification}, rather than a naive aggregation. In ``true''
diversification, people would choose a set of projects that are partially (and
ideally negatively) correlated, as per \textcite{markowitz1952}. However, in reality
people that intend to diversify only seem diversify naively, meaning that they
neglect co-variation when diversifying \autocite[e.g.,][]{hedesstrom2006}. Instead, they
only seem to be looking for variety, rather than diversification in the strict
sense. This \emph{diversification bias} is also seen in product choices \autocite{read1995}.

In Experiment~1, participants may have considered the high similarity condition
as a sign that the set of projects may not be sufficiently ``diversified.''
However, this explanation would also predict the joint presentation condition to
be lower in the high similarity condition. So, perhaps when in the separate
condition, participants were constantly thinking that they might be getting a
different project in the next display, so rejected more projects because of the
lack of diversification, but not realising that they would not be getting any
other type of project. Those in the joint presentation, on the other hand, were
able to see all ten projects, so already knew that there were no other projects
in the set, and so were less likely to reject projects on the basis of the hope
for different projects in the future.

\subsubsection{Limitations}

This experiment had two major limitations. First, proper counterbalancing was
not used in the high alignment project domain, nor in the order of the
within-subjects manipulation of presentation. As such, it is unclear what role
these elements played in the results, especially in the presentation condition,
in which participants always saw the separate condition first. Second, as
mentioned above in Section~\ref{outcome-distribution-materials-aggregation-1},
there was a mistake in the generation of the gamble values that meant that the
individual gambles did not correspond with the distribution that participants
saw. Both of these limitations were addressed in Experiment~2.

\hypertarget{aggregation-2}{%
\section{Experiment~2}\label{aggregation-2}}

Experiment~2 investigated the effect of presentation, awareness, and
distribution on project choice. For the distribution manipulation, half of the
sample saw an outcome probability distribution as in the previous literature
\autocites[e.g.,][]{redelmeier1992,webb2017} to determine their risk aversion when the
gambles are explicitly aggregated. In contrast to most of the repeated-play
choice literature, each choice was presented without subsequent feedback.
Further, in contrast to Experiment~1, the distribution was displayed alongside
each gamble, as opposed to only at the very end. This is an important
manipulation because finding out whether it is effective will (a) add to the
understanding of the conditions necessary for mathematical aggregation (beyond a
mere intuitive sense of aggregation), and (b) suggest new ways to encourage
aggregation in real-world applications.

In past work, participants were shown ordinary binomial distributions, since
multi-play gambles are identical. However, there has not been an investigation
of \emph{non-identical} gamble distributions in this context. Doing this requires
using a \emph{Poisson} binomial distribution, which allows for multiple trials with
different probabilities.

Further, Experiment~2 addressed potential order effects in Experiment~1 by
manipulating all the main variables between-subjects. Manipulating presentation
between-subjects, removes the potentially confounding factor of reduced risk
aversion over time.

Experiment~2 again tested Hypotheses~\ref{hyp:awareness-aggregation-1},
and~\ref{hyp:presentation-aggregation-1}, from Experiment~1. Further, following
the finding in Experiment~1 that participants in the aware condition seemed to
become more risk-taking as the experiment progressed, Experiment~2 tested the
following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[interaction of trial number and awareness]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:awareness-trials-aggregation-2}{}{\label{hyp:awareness-trials-aggregation-2} \iffalse (interaction of trial number and awareness) \fi{} }Participants will make more risky choices as the trials progress, but only when
they are aware of the total number of projects in the set.
\end{hypothesis}

Further, multi-play gambles with outcome distributions have been shown to reduce
risk aversion compared to multi-play gambles without distributions \autocites[e.g.,][]{redelmeier1992,webb2017}. Therefore, Experiment~2 tested the following
hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[distribution effect]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:distribution-aggregation-2}{}{\label{hyp:distribution-aggregation-2} \iffalse (distribution effect) \fi{} }Participants will make more risky choices when presented with an aggregated
outcome distribution than when making the same decisions individually.
\end{hypothesis}

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

One hundred and sixty-four participants (51 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 26.39 years (\emph{SD} = 8.63, \emph{min.} = 18, \emph{max.} = 72). Participants reported an average of 2.55 years (\emph{SD} = 5.34, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 43) working in a business setting, and an average of 1.67 years (\emph{SD} = 2.94, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 20) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 6.53 min (\emph{SD} = 5.15, \emph{min.} = 1.18, \emph{max.} = 39.93).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-aggregation-2}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions.
Appendix~\ref{power-analysis-aggregation-2} describes the power analysis
conducted to arrive at this sample size.

Participants were shown the same instructions as in Experiment~1 (see
Section~\ref{instructions-materials-aggregation-1}).

\hypertarget{task-aggregation-2}{%
\paragraph{Risky Investment Task}\label{task-aggregation-2}}

Participants saw a similar display to the one in Experiment~1 (see
Section~\ref{task-aggregation-1}), but with new gamble values, in order to fix
the mistake in the Experiment~1 gamble value calculation (detailed in the
appendix Section~\ref{outcome-distribution-aggregation-1}).

The presentation and awareness manipulations were as in Experiment~1. However,
in the distribution-present condition participants saw the outcome probability
distribution of all the projects alongside the description, rather than after
all the projects were seen (see
Figure~\ref{fig:separate-distribution-present-aggregation-2}).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/separate-distribution-present-aggregation-2-1} \caption{An example of a display seen by those in the separate distribution-present condition of Experiment~2.}\label{fig:separate-distribution-present-aggregation-2}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{follow-up-aggregation-2}{%
\paragraph{Follow-up}\label{follow-up-aggregation-2}}

Participants were asked how many projects they thought they saw, whether they
were willing to accept all or none of the projects, and how many they would be
willing to accept if they had to choose a number.
Appendix~\ref{follow-up-materials-aggregation-2-appendix} shows these
questions.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants read the instructions and completed the risky investment task in
their respective conditions. After seeing the individual projects, participants
were then asked the three follow-up questions.

\hypertarget{results-aggregation-2}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-aggregation-2}}

\subsubsection{Project Investment}

The project investment data were analysed as proportions of choice per
participant, as in Experiment~1. Each experimental condition was compared to the
same control condition (separate presentation, naive awareness, and distribution
absent). Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-2-proportion} shows these data. The
difference between presentation conditions was not significant,
\(F(1, 80) = 0.00\), \(p > .999\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .000\). Similarly, the
difference between awareness conditions was not significant,
\(F(1, 79) = 0.44\), \(p = .508\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .006\). However, those that that saw a
distribution chose to invest significantly more
(51.19\%) than those that did
not see a distribution
(39.02\%),
\(F(1, 81) = 4.46\), \(p = .038\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .052\).



\begin{figure}

Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. Raw data are plotted in the background.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-2-proportion}
\end{figure}

Further, as Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-2-choice-trials} shows, it
doesn't seem as if the previous awareness by trial effect was replicated.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Follow-up}

The portfolio choice data from both the number and binary questions were
congruent with the above, finding that those in the distribution condition were
more likely to invest (see Appendix~\ref{results-aggregation-2-appendix}).

\hypertarget{discussion-aggregation-4}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-aggregation-4}}

Experiment~2 found support for
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:distribution-aggregation-2}. Seeing an outcome
distribution of a business project portfolio had a strong effect on
participants' decision-making. Participants indicated that they would invest in
more projects and were more likely to indicate that they would invest in the
entire portfolio. However, the awareness and presentation effects found in
Experiment~1 (see Section~\ref{results-aggregation-1}) did not replicate.

These findings provide evidence for choice bracketing. That is, people do seem
to be primarily considering gambles one at a time. Further, these findings
suggest that that the main bottleneck for appropriately aggregating a set of
gambles is a computational one. That is, people simply cannot mentally combine
the outcomes and probabilities in a way that sufficiently approximates the
outcome distribution display.

The lack of replication of the awareness and presentation effects provides
evidence against a naive aggregation account of the distribution effect.
Specifically this suggests that the distribution effect is a result of a lack of
ability to mathematically combine risk, rather than naive aggregation. If some
of the bottleneck was attributable to a lack of realisation that the individual
gambles could be grouped together, then the effects from Experiment~1 should
have replicated. Instead it seems that even when people have an opportunity to
consider an entire set of risky choices together (and consider that the gains
may outweigh the losses), they do not do this.

In Experiment~2, all the gambles came from the same domain. This was done to
attempt to replicate the relevant effects from Experiment~1. However, there
could have been something about that particular domain that led to the lack of
replication. A follow-up experiment addressed this issue by presenting
participants with 20 gambles from 10 different industries and still did not
replicate the awareness effect (see Appendix~\ref{aggregation-4}).

\section{General Discussion}

When making one decision about a series of risky choices, it is clear that
people have an intuitive sense of the advantages of risk aggregation \autocite[e.g.,][]{samuelson1963}. However, because risky choices are typically made one at a time
in the real world, this chapter aimed to identify whether (and how) this
intuition could be leveraged in this more realistic scenario. Overall, there was
little evidence that subtle cues could tap into this intuitive advantage of risk
aggregation, and clear visualisations of outcome distributions were needed to
assist people's risk aggregation. This suggests that the act of deciding can
create a strong cognitive barrier to treating a series of decisions as if they
were one. However, as elaborated below, the success of the outcome distribution
for overcoming this cognitive barrier in the current paradigm is a novel and
important finding.

This chapter found that some choice bracketing facilitated risk aggregation in
description-based repeated-play gambles. This paradigm has never been a target
of research. Early work on risk aggregation involved multi-play gambles, which
treated gambles as simultaneous and identical. However, most risky choice
outside the lab involves considering multiple choices independently, as in
repeated-play paradigms. Most repeated-play paradigms have involved providing
participants with feedback, or allowing them to sample from outcome
distributions. Large real-life investments are different, as their outcomes are
not eventuated immediately (and do not allow for distribution sampling). The
limited prior work using description-based repeated-play gambles did not
consider the effect of choice bracketing on risk aggregation. As such, the
paradigm used in this chapter allowed for the investigation of choice bracketing
in a way that is more isomorphic with real-life prescriptions.

Experiment~1 found evidence for the effects of similarity, presentation, and
awareness of the number of projects. Experiment~2 found evidence for the effect
of an outcome distribution but did not replicate the presentation and awareness
effects. Subsequent follow up experiments (reported in
Appendices~\ref{aggregation-3} and~\ref{aggregation-4}) again tested the
similarity and awareness effects. These experiments found evidence for naive
diversification (an advantage for low similarity) when considering all projects
once and did not replicate the trial-by-trial interaction from Experiment~1.

Therefore, in addition to the novelty of the paradigm itself, this chapter found
that choice bracketing facilitates risk aggregation, if aided by the aggregated
distribution. As per Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:distribution-aggregation-2},
Experiment~2 found that showing a distribution of outcome probabilities without
inter-trial feedback reduced risk aversion. Further, there was mixed evidence
for Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:similarity-aggregation-1}, such that people were less
risk averse when the set of projects they saw were dissimilar, but only when
offered them as a portfolio (see Appendix~\ref{aggregation-3}). There was only
minimal evidence for Hypotheses~\ref{hyp:awareness-aggregation-1}
and~\ref{hyp:presentation-aggregation-1}, suggesting that viewing projects
together and an awareness of the number of projects are not sufficient to
encourage aggregation. Altogether, it seems that subtle contextual cues are
often not sufficient to encourage risk aggregation and that people need risk to
be is aggregated for them explicitly in order to understand the benefits of
aggregation.

\subsection{Theoretical Implications}

The finding that participants are less risk averse when provided with an
aggregated outcome distribution is congruent with previous work \autocite[e.g.,][]{redelmeier1992}. However, when distributions have been previously used, gambles
were identical---as in multi-play paradigms---and used immediate feedback for
repeated-play paradigms \autocite[e.g.,][]{benartzi1999}. As mentioned previously, both
these paradigms have limited ecological validity because usually people are
faced with non-identical sequential choices and do not receive immediate
feedback. This work is the first to provide evidence for this aggregation effect
with non-identical gambles without feedback.

The other choice bracketing findings that showed little success with aiding
aggregation are less congruent with previous research. \textcite{sokolhessner2009} and
\textcite{sokolhessner2012} found that encouraging participants to make decisions akin to
a professional investor increased the amount of risky choices they made. The
results showed that a subtler manipulation---whether or not participants were
aware of the number of choices to be made---is not sufficient to encourage
aggregation. \textcite{hsee1999} found that useful, but hard-to-interpret, attributes were
used more when the options were presented jointly, rather than separately. In
the case of these experiments, the ``hard to interpret'' element of the decision
set was the risk of the projects. Contrary to \textcite{hsee1999}, it seems that risk was
not always accounted for more when projects were presented jointly, rather than
separately. More study is needed to understand whether the effects that were
seen in Experiment~1 but not replicated in the subsequent experiments are due to
statistical chance or unexplored elements of the experiment.

Research on the effect of option similarity on choice \autocite[e.g.,][]{markman1995}
suggests that alignable differences are more important than non-alignable
differences. Further, the effects of multi-play gambles and outcome
distributions on risk aggregation are only seen when participants perceive the
options as fungible \autocite[e.g.,][]{dekay2005}. As such, it was predicted that a set of
investments that involve the same type of investment would be seen as more
similar, and therefore be considered as fungible.
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:similarity-aggregation-1} predicted that this would
facilitate a broad bracketing, and therefore more risk aggregation.

Instead, the results showed that choice similarity did not affect individual
project allocations. However, when participants were given an all-or-nothing
choice for the entire set of projects, those that viewed dissimilar projects
were more likely to take the entire set projects than those that viewed similar
projects. This is different from the initial hypothesis, however, it may still
suggest an effect of choice bracketing. That is, this effect was only found when
participants were asked about the entire portfolio of projects, rather than when
they had a chance to make a choice about each project. The way that the question
was framed may have acted to broadly bracket the choices by forcing the choice.

A diversified portfolio is one whose investments are uncorrelated or negatively
correlated. According to portfolio theory \autocite{markowitz1952}, a diversified
portfolio is preferred to one that is not diversified, because it reduces the
probability of a loss. When some investments have losses, others will have
gains---the root of ``don't keep all your eggs in one basket.'' Typically,
questions of gamble aggregation assume that each gamble is independent. That is,
the gambles are uncorrelated. As such, aggregation of a portfolio already
assumes that the portfolio is somewhat diversified (or at least that the gambles
aren't perfectly correlated).

In the case of the similarity effect, the choice bracketing did not seem to
encourage aggregation, but instead appears to have encouraged a naive
diversification \autocite{hedesstrom2006,read1995}. It could not have been actual
diversification, because the projects did not contain correlational information.
Rather, participants could have been more eager to accept the project portfolio
due to the higher variability between projects (due to the similarity
manipulation).

This finding suggests that there may be trade-off between aggregation and
diversification. The literature shows that people prefer multi-play gambles to
single-play gambles. However, participants in this chapter were more likely to
aggregate diverse repeated-play gambles to similar repeated-play gambles when
these were bracketed broadly. Therefore, people are likely to still need choice
bracketing. That is, diverse repeated-play gambles that are not bracketed are
simply individual single-play gambles.

One way to test this explanation is by using identical gambles. This chapter
used unique gambles to increase ecological validity. However, the above
explanation would predict that participants prefer non-identical repeated-play
gambles to identical repeated-play gambles when these are bracketed. However,
when these gambles are not presented as a portfolio, it is likely that the
identical gambles would be preferred overall because the non-identical gambles
would be represented as individual single-play gambles.

It is also possible that similarity effects were not seen because the sequence
of gambles itself led to naive aggregation for all conditions. One way that this
could be tested is by interweaving other tasks in-between the gambles to break
them up. Then similarity may play a role by allowing bracketing across otherwise
distinct gambles. Multiple sets of gambles can be interweaved with similarity
alone creating the potential sets. The prediction is that without similarity the
gambles would not be aggregated.

\subsubsection{How Does Choice Bracketing Facilitate Aggregation?}

Much of the literature \autocite[e.g.,][]{benartzi1999} is not clear about why choice
bracketing occurs. Some explain the effect of bracketing on aggregation using
risk aversion \autocite[e.g.,][]{read1999}, while others refer to the increased weighting
of potential losses \autocite{webb2017}.

Decision-from-experience \emph{sampling} studies explain the underweighting of rare
events (as opposed to the overweighting that occurs with
decisions-from-description) by sampling bias and recency effects \autocites[e.g.,][]{hertwig2004,wulff2018}. That is, they explain that people are less risk
averse for positive EV gambles because when they sample from the distribution
they only sample a small amount (usually approximately 20 times) so they do not
experience rare events very often. Also, the latter half of the sequence of
sampling is significantly more predictive than the former (recency effect). Some
decision-from-experience \emph{feedback} studies explain this effect by ``choice
inertia'' \autocite{camilleri2011}. That is, ``the tendency to repeat the last choice,
irrespective of the obtained outcome'' (p.~383). However, there is not much more
elaboration beyond this. Repeated-play gambles show more underweighting than
multi-play gambles. This is said to be due to a ``reliance on a very small set of
samples'' \autocite[p.~64]{camilleri2013}. However, this explanation does not account for
repeated-play effects independently.

The experiments in this chapter shed some light about the mechanisms behind why
choice bracketing may affect risk aggregation in repeated-play gambles without
feedback. Two explanations were proposed: participants may realise that some
gains will offset the losses, or they may need explicit aggregation. Not finding
evidence for the subtle choice bracketing manipulations suggests that people do
not intuitively consider that the gains of their choices may offset the
potential losses. Perhaps the possibility of recouped losses would become more
salient when other participants are explicitly told of this possibility, as in
\textcite{sokolhessner2009}. Their explicit instruction manipulation is introduced above
as appearing unrealistically strong, but the results of this chapter suggest
that people do need very explicit scaffolding in order to use risk aggregation.

\subsection{Practical Implications}

This research implies some prescriptions for capital allocation decision-making.
For instance, even if managers implement processes that encourage a joint
evaluation of projects, this may be insufficient to encourage aggregation.
Projects need to very explicitly be considered as individual components in a
portfolio in order to facilitate better risk aggregation. Some companies are
already implementing processes that make this more explicit \autocite{lovallo2020}. This
is especially important for those that would still have to evaluate projects
separately. Further, this work shows the importance of being explicit about the
forecasted probabilities of project success. Doing this is necessary for the
aggregation process. Even more ideal would be to forecast project success using
an entire probability distribution for the different possible outcomes. However,
research shows that people struggle to construct such distributions \autocites[e.g.,][]{alpert1982,schaefer1973,staelvonholstein1971,tversky1974} and
Chapter~\ref{alignment} shows that people struggle to use such variance
information when making allocation decisions. Regardless, the benefits of risk
aggregation can be used even if forecast information is limited (e.g., only a
point estimate and a probability) and only one project is being considered.
Specifically, a proposed project can be seen in a larger context by aggregating
it with projects from the immediate past.

Interestingly, participants were less risk averse about a portfolio of projects
when industries differed, compared to when they were all from the same industry.
Simply manipulating the similarity of financially-irrelevant semantics of a set
of choices affected participants' risk aversion. This has implications for
managerial settings. Executives in multi-business firms often have to make
capital allocation decisions that involve comparing dissimilar projects. How can
an oil well exploration project be appropriately compared to an oil refinery? Or
to a microchip project? Chapter~\ref{alignment} suggests that evaluating
dissimilar business projects is more difficult to comparing similar projects.
The current work suggests that managers may actually be \emph{less} likely to realise
the benefits of aggregation when they are in a less diversified company. As
such, managers should complement an understanding of aggregation with that of
diversification. This might help to avoid being biased by a lack of variety of
projects despite a potentially high level of diversification.

\subsection{Future Research}

The main novelty of the experiments in this chapter comes from increasing
ecological validity of risky choice problems by removing inter-trial feedback.
Future work should test even more realistic scenarios. Such studies should
involve managers, ideally in multi-business firms. Investigating whether the
choice bracketing findings from these experiments replicates in a sample of
managers will help to determine whether these results could be applied to
real-world managerial decision-making. This is especially important since
\textcite{haigh2005} found that professional traders show more myopic loss aversion than
students. Further, the similarity, awareness, and presentation manipulations
should be tested with managers since it is possible that they have a greater
sense of naive aggregation and are therefore more likely to be more amenable to
such manipulations. The addition of extra payment for better performance on the
task might also assist in making the task more isomorphic with real-world
managerial decisions. Further, in the present experiments, participants viewed
the projects all in the space of one session. However, this is not completely
isomorphic to real life, where managers make many other decisions that are
unrelated to the large risky investments at their companies. Future research
should test participants over a longer period of time \autocite[as in][]{beshears2016} in
order to see whether the effects of the manipulations replicate in a more
realistic environment.

\chapter{Joint Evaluation of Multiple Projects}\label{interstitial-1}}

Chapter~\ref{aggregation} found that people struggle to aggregate risk even
when provided with choice bracketing cues that could have built on an intuitive
sense of how aggregation reduces risk. The finding that people are more likely
to accept many gambles at once \autocites[e.g.,][]{samuelson1963,wedell1994}, even without
any aids to calculate risk, suggests that people can gain an intuition for the
benefits of aggregation. Yet, in the current work, people instead considered
projects one at a time and only leveraged the benefits of aggregation when given
an explicit visualisation of what it entails.

This shows that it is important to change organisational policy to encourage
considering business projects jointly. Doing this means that the risk can be
concurrently aggregated. In real-life capital allocation scenarios, when
managers evaluate projects sequentially, an aggregated distribution can also be
presented using any number of projects that were considered in the recent past.
This means that a strategy of project risk aggregation can be implemented at any
stage in an organisation's lifespan. Relatively new ventures can implement these
recommendations by waiting until a certain number of project proposals have been
accrued before aggregating.

Considering projects jointly is also useful for accountability purposes. The
usual incentive structure in organisations that judges each project outcome
independently is likely to punish risk-taking due to its potential negative
consequences and not due to the information that was available at the time of
evaluation. Framing a set of projects as a portfolio means that any subsequent
success or failure of one project can be traced back to the entire batch, and
the performance of the whole portfolio can be evaluated.

Business projects might not always be either accepted or rejected, as in
Chapter~\ref{aggregation}. Instead, top-level managers might ask for project
proposals from lower-level managers, and then allocate funds from the available
budget. An organisation might also have a initial ``culling'' phase, and a
subsequent ranking phase. When initially considering a set of projects, some
might be rejected according to certain rules. For instance, an NPV might not
meet a certain minimum cut-off. The remaining projects in the set can then be
ranked in order of priority and receive an allocation of capital from the
budget.

A few potential problems arise at the point that projects are considered jointly
for ranking and allocation. For instance, it might not be easy to compare
between the projects in the set. As discussed in Chapter~\ref{introduction},
diversification of business units has become very popular in large
organisations. Therefore, most hierarchical organisations are likely to face
difficult comparisons when deciding on how to rank and allocate capital to
projects that originated in different divisions. A non-hierarchical organisation
that develops one type of product may be able to simply compare across any
number of intrinsic project attributes, whereas a diversified organisation is
likely to have to rely on more abstract financial metrics, such as NPV. Such
metrics are ``abstract'' because they can be applied in almost any domain.

For instance, when comparing across two oil well projects, there can be both
attributes intrinsic to the project, such as the amount of hydrocarbons that are
extracted per hour, and also the more abstract financial metrics. There is a
potential interaction between the ease that managers have to compare across the
projects and the kinds of measures that are used to make the comparison. Two
similar projects, such as two oil wells can be evaluated using litres of
hydrocarbons extracted per hour, whereas an oil refinery cannot. In the case
that two dissimilar projects are compared, managers can use financial metrics to
compare across domains. This can lead to comparable accuracy as long as the
abstract metrics are as reliable as the intrinsic project features.

A concern that arises out of a reliance on such metrics is that underlying
variance is not taken into account. Forecast estimates such as NPV rely on many
assumptions and contain much inherent uncertainty, so managers that use them
should be cautious about over-relying on them. Chapter~\ref{alignment} tests
people's sensitivity to forecast estimate variance information. That is, will
people use NPV more when the variance information suggests that it is a reliable
measure, than when the information suggests that it is unreliable?

Chapter~\ref{aggregation} manipulated project presentation and found no
significant difference between when projects were considered jointly or
separately. This was explained by the bounds on people's ability to intuitively
aggregate. However, it was unclear what components of the projects people
focused on both because they were not explicitly manipulated and because the
task involved a binary choice (accept or reject). A relative allocation measure
for multiple projects with systematically varied attributes would allow to
determine the influence of those different attributes. Therefore,
Chapter~\ref{alignment} considers the situation in which people are already
presented with choices together and asked to evaluate the projects by allocating
a hypothetical budget.

Further, Chapter~\ref{alignment} identifies the factors that affect people's
decisions independently from the potential risk of losing hypothetical money,
which is a large reason for the effects in the previous chapter. Risk aversion
is accounted for by making it clear that no losses are possible. This is
achieved by using only positive NPVs, which implies that the project is not
forecasted to lose money.

Chapter~\ref{alignment} also manipulates how easy the project attributes are to
compare. This helps identify the ways that decision-making in a diversified
organisation may be different to that of a more integrated organisation.
Chapter~\ref{aggregation} manipulated similarity by either showing a set of
projects from the same industry or a set from different industries. This was
meant to simulate an integrated and diversified firm, respectively. This
manipulation was not as strong because there were no project attributes that
could be aligned or not. That is, there was nothing actually non-alignable. This
may explain the equivocal similarity effect. In Chapter~\ref{alignment},
alignability is more fully manipulated by having project attributes be critical
to the evaluation. These project features are shown explicitly so that the
difficulty of the comparison is more obvious.

\section{Introduction}

One of the most important tasks faced by executives is the allocation of capital
within their companies. This requires the ranking of projects by importance and
predicted success, and allocating the limited capital accordingly (not unlike a
scientific funding agency). Ranking of projects necessitates comparing them
across a number of dimensions. For example, the executive of an oil company may
have received multiple oil exploration proposals. Determining what makes one oil
exploration project better than another is relatively simple. However, consider
a different scenario in which the executive must allocate capital between an oil
exploration project and an oil refinery project. The dimensions of oil refinery
projects that distinguish superior from inferior projects may be totally
different from those of oil exploration projects. Consider a funding agency
having to decide between two cognitive scientists or between a cognitive
scientist and a physicist in awarding a fellowship. What makes a physics
proposal better for the field of physics than a cognitive science proposal for
cognitive science?

Structure-mapping theory \autocite{gentner1997,gentner1983} provides a model of
comparison that psychologically distinguishes these two kinds of allocation
tasks. This framework models comparison as a process of mapping and alignment of
the shared dimensions of two conceptual structures. This mapping process reveals
the shared dimensions of the two structures as well as the differences in those
shared dimensions (known as \emph{alignable differences}). For example, when
comparing two oil exploration projects, the process for measuring the quantity
of hydrocarbons in a prospective oil field may be identical, but the specific
quantities measured will differ. This is known as an alignable difference; that
is, the difference constrained within the same dimension. However, when
comparing an oil field and a refinery, there will be a significantly higher
number of \emph{non-alignable differences}, because the two domains do not share
component dimensions. That is, the dimensional structure of processes in the
exploration project will be substantially different from that of processes in
the refinery project, making it difficult to find meaningful alignments. With a
higher number of non-alignable differences, there are fewer opportunities to
make meaningful comparisons, leading to greater difficulty in predicting project
success and ranking projects. This chapter experimentally examined project
comparisons and how such comparisons may affect capital allocation decisions.
The working hypothesis is that projects that have a higher number of alignable
differences will lead to more precise and informed project predictions and
rankings compared with projects with non-alignable differences.

However, what happens when a task demands that two domains be aligned but they
are too disparate to align? Experimentally, this territory is somewhat
uncharted. It is expected that, when required, people will grasp at any piece of
information available and attempt to abstract and infer that which is reasonable
to ease the alignment. This occurs frequently in business settings. Because
corporate enterprises continue to embrace diversification strategies in their
investments, they must constantly make capital allocation decisions involving
highly disparate domains. To overcome these difficult comparisons, executives
rely on various financial measures that, in theory, may be applied to any
project or business proposal. These financial measures work well to ease the
burden of difficult comparisons because they ignore the complexities of
individual projects and focus solely on financial information such as total cost
and projected profits. Therefore, projects that are difficult to compare may be
evaluated more easily by comparing individual numerical measures.

The most common financial measure that is used by executives in order to value
business project proposals is NPV \autocite{graham2001,remer1993,graham2015}. NPV is
the difference between the forecasted revenue of a project and the initial
investment in its development (accounting for the time value of money), as shown
in Equation~\eqref{eq:npv}. NPV is commonly used in decisions about capital
allocation and investment. The basic rule is that if a project has a positive
NPV, it is financially viable, and if it has a negative NPV, it is not. However,
the use of NPV has been criticised, by both academics and practitioners
\autocite{fox2008,willigers2017}. The main criticism is that there can be underlying
sources of variance in NPV that are not reflected in the final measure, which is
expressed as a single numerical value. For instance, NPV is dependent on the
projected cash inflows for each year of the project. However, financial
forecasting is frequently inaccurate and prone to optimism bias \autocite{lovallo2003,puri2007}. Therefore, there is bound to be variation in the reliability of NPV
measures as a function of the forecasting error in the cash flow calculations.
Project duration and the discount rate are further sources of variance that may
be hidden by the single numerical value of NPV.

The secondary goal of this research is to investigate the extent to which people
are sensitive to variance information (from financial forecasting) when making
capital allocation decisions. This consideration is especially important in the
capital allocation situations illustrated above, when executives need to compare
projects with disparate domains and must, therefore, rely on NPV. This matters
because the NPV of different domains may have different underlying forecasting
error, potentially compromising the utility of using NPV as the basis of
comparison. Do executives sufficiently account for the inherent sources of
variance in the measure on which they rely so heavily? Research shows that
people are effective at extracting variance information when exposed to
numerical sequences \autocite{rosenbaum2020}. However, they struggle to use variance
information when it is represented numerically \autocite{galesic2010,konold1993,vivalt2021,batteux2020}.

\subsection{Experiment Summary}

Experiment~1 investigated the effect of project alignment on the decision-making
of naive participants asked to allocate capital to a set of fictional projects.
Naive participants were assumed to have no requisite knowledge about NPV
reliability; thus, NPV reliability level was manipulated by directly telling
participants whether or not the given NPV was reliable. For this experiment, it
was predicted that when projects are alignable, participants who are told NPV is
reliable would use it in their decision-making, while participants who are told
that NPV was unreliable would not use it in their decision-making. However, when
projects are not alignable, it was predicted that participants would use NPV,
regardless of the stated NPV reliability level.

Experiment~2 investigated the decision-making of management students in a
similar situation to Experiment~1. The main difference was that instead of
telling participants whether or not the NPV was reliable, the level of
\emph{numerical} NPV reliability---that is, the width of the numerical range around
the average NPV---was manipulated. Similar to Experiment~1, it was predicted
that participants would rely more on NPV in non-alignable projects than in
alignable projects. However, it was predicted that numerical reliability level
would have no effect because there is little evidence that people are sensitive
to variance information when it is shown numerically.

Experiment~3 also tested the effects of project alignment and reliability level
in a non-business population but manipulated both verbal and numerical
reliability to enable a direct comparison. The term \emph{reliability level} is used
to describe the manipulation of whether NPV was expressed as a reliable measure
or not, while \emph{reliability type} is used to describe the manipulation of whether
reliability was expressed verbally or numerically. Experiment~3 predicted a
reliability level effect for the verbal reliability condition but not the
numerical reliability condition. Further, this experiment used project
descriptions with clearer profitability indicators and added a larger selection
of business industries.

\hypertarget{alignment-2}{%
\section{Experiment~1}\label{alignment-2}}

Experiment~1 investigated the effects of project alignment and explicit NPV
reliability information on capital allocation decisions. The structural
alignment literature suggests that people place more weight on alignable
differences than they do on non-alignable differences. It was expected that
participants would rely more on NPV than on other product attributes in their
decision-making because NPV may be applied to every product. However, this
effect should vary with participants' perceived NPV reliability level. That is,
if other project dimensions are alignable, the use of NPV may depend on its
reliability. However, it was predicted that in projects with low alignment,
there will be a greater reliance on NPV as the sole alignable difference,
regardless of its stated reliability. These effects were measured by considering
the linear relationship between NPV and the money allocated to each project.
Critically, the NPV and intrinsic features of each project shown to participants
were inversely related. Therefore, a positive NPV trend will indicate a heavier
reliance on NPV, whereas a negative trend will indicate a heavier reliance on
the intrinsic project features. First, Experiment~1 tested the following omnibus
hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[overall effect]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:three-way-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:three-way-alignment-2} \iffalse (overall effect) \fi{} }The alignment \(\times\) reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction is
significant.
\end{hypothesis}

Initially, specific effects were tested by excluding the no NPV condition (in
which participants were not given NPV information). Given the difficulty of
comparing dissimilar projects, participants were expected to rely more heavily
on NPV when project attributes are not alignable compared with when they are
alignable. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[alignment effect]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2} \iffalse (alignment effect) \fi{} }The linear NPV trend will be stronger for projects with low alignment than for
projects with high alignment.
\end{hypothesis}

Participants' budget allocations were expected to depend on the provided NPV
reliability information. However, this is more likely when there are multiple
aligned metrics from which to choose compared with when NPV only is alignable.
Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[the NPV reliability level effect depends on alignment]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2} \iffalse (the NPV reliability level effect depends on alignment) \fi{} }The NPV \(\times\) reliability level interaction will be stronger in the high
alignment than in low alignment.
\end{hypothesis}

Specifically, when projects are similar, it is expected that participants will
rely more on NPV if they are told that NPV is reliable (leading to a positive
NPV trend) but more on the intrinsic features of projects if they are told that
NPV is unreliable (leading to a negative NPV trend). However, when projects are
dissimilar, it is expected that participants will rely solely on NPV, regardless
of what they are told about its reliability. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the
following hypotheses:

\begin{hypothesis}[NPV reliability level in high alignment]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2} \iffalse (NPV reliability level in high alignment) \fi{} }When projects have high alignment, the NPV trend will be stronger when NPV
reliability is high compared with when NPV reliability is low.
\end{hypothesis}

\begin{hypothesis}[NPV reliability level in low alignment]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2} \iffalse (NPV reliability level in low alignment) \fi{} }When projects have low alignment, the NPV trend will not differ significantly
between the two reliability level conditions.
\end{hypothesis}

A no NPV condition was used to gain a better understanding of participants'
baseline response to materials when they had no information about NPV. The
extent of participants' reliance on NPV was determined by comparing this no NPV
condition to the conditions in which NPV was present. When projects are similar,
this condition was expected to be equivalent to the low NPV reliability
condition because in this condition participants should disregard NPV. When
projects are dissimilar, this condition was expected to show the average
participant value judgements of the project descriptions, because they only had
the intrinsic project features for their evaluations. This was expected to
result in a flat NPV trend. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the following
hypotheses:

\begin{hypothesis}[effect of NPV information for projects with high alignment]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-alignment-high-no-NPV-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-alignment-high-no-NPV-alignment-2} \iffalse (effect of NPV information for projects with high alignment) \fi{} }For projects with high alignment, the positive NPV trend will be stronger for
projects with high NPV reliability compared with projects with no NPV
information.
\end{hypothesis}

\begin{hypothesis}[effect of NPV information for projects with low alignment]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-alignment-low-no-NPV-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-alignment-low-no-NPV-alignment-2} \iffalse (effect of NPV information for projects with low alignment) \fi{} }For projects with low alignment, the positive NPV trend will be stronger for
projects with both low and high NPV reliability compared with projects with no
NPV information.
\end{hypothesis}

\subsubsection{Participants}

One hundred and eighteen participants (55 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 29.42 years (\emph{SD} = 9.25, \emph{min.} = 18, \emph{max.} = 73).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-alignment-2}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions. NPV was varied
within subjects.

\hypertarget{instructions-materials-alignment-2}{%
\paragraph{Instructions}\label{instructions-materials-alignment-2}}

Participants, who did not necessarily have business experience, were first shown
an instructions page with information about the task and NPV. These instructions
also informed participants about whether NPV as a financial measure was reliable
or unreliable for the specific project. Participants in the low NPV reliability
level conditions were told that NPV was an unreliable metric, while those in the
high NPV reliability level conditions were told that NPV was a reliable metric.
Instructions provided to participants in the no NPV condition did not include an
explanation of NPV or its reliability. Critically, participants were asked to
invest in products with a high objective value (because a higher-quality product
is not always better in the consumer goods market). Given that participants may
not use this instruction when directly viewing the projects, Experiment~3 used
projects whose attributes inherently expressed their quality.
Appendix~\ref{instructions-materials-alignment-2-appendix} shows the
instructions used in Experiment~1.

\hypertarget{projects-materials-alignment-2}{%
\paragraph{Project Display}\label{projects-materials-alignment-2}}

Participants were provided with a set of fictional business projects to which
they were asked to allocate capital. Alignment manipulation was reinforced
through visual presentation. Projects with high alignment were displayed in a
table listing their various attributes (see
Figure~\ref{fig:projects-alignment-high-materials-alignment-2}). In this group,
each project involved the same product type with consistent concrete attributes.
The table format was more appropriate for the high alignment condition because
all dimensions were shared. In contrast, projects with low alignment were
presented as paragraphs describing their relevant attributes (see
Figure~\ref{fig:projects-alignment-low-materials-alignment-2}). In this group,
each project was a different product with concrete attributes specific to that
product. In both alignment conditions, each project description included an NPV.
Critically, the values of the concrete attributes were always in conflict with
the NPV. For instance, Project 4 always had the lowest value for each concrete
attribute but always had the highest NPV. This meant that participants'
allocations could be used as a proxy for their degree of dependence on NPV.

Presentation style was potentially a confounding factor. This was addressed in
Experiment~3 by using the table format for both alignment conditions.

\paragraph{Allocation}

Participants completed a capital allocation task (see
Figure~\ref{fig:allocation-alignment-2}) adapted from \textcite{bardolet2011} in which
they were asked to allocate a hypothetical yearly budget across the given five
projects.

\paragraph{Additional Measures}

Other measures apart from allocation were included. The stimuli for and analyses
of these measures are reported in
Appendices~\ref{materials-alignment-2-appendix}
and~\ref{results-alignment-2-appendix}, respectively. Specifically,
participants were asked to forecast the future returns of the projects (see
Figure~\ref{fig:forecasting-materials-alignment-2}), rank the projects (see
Figure~\ref{fig:ranking-materials-alignment-2}), indicate their confidence in
their decisions (see Figure~\ref{fig:confidence-materials-alignment-2}), and
justify their decisions (see
Figure~\ref{fig:justification-materials-alignment-2}).

\subsubsection{Procedure}

After reading the relevant instruction page, participants allocated to the low
alignment conditions completed the forecasting task directly beneath each
project display. For the high alignment conditions, this was done directly
beneath all projects. Participants were then asked to rank the projects and
subsequently answer the allocation, confidence, and justification questions.

\subsection{Results}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of project
alignment and NPV reliability level on participants' budget allocations. As
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-2-allocation}, the alignment \(\times\)
NPV reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was significant,
\(F(6.57, 367.76) = 2.18\), \(p = .039\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .038\). The
analyses excluding the no NPV condition showed the expected results. The NPV
trend averaged across both reliability level conditions was stronger for the low
alignment conditions than for the high alignment conditions,
\(M = 61.70\), 95\% CI \([33.02,~90.37]\), \(t(76) = 4.29\), \(p < .001\). This shows that people
relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar than when they were similar.

Further, the NPV \(\times\) NPV reliability level interaction was stronger in the high
alignment conditions than in the low alignment conditions,
\(M = 67.81\), 95\% CI \([10.47,~125.16]\), \(t(76) = 2.36\), \(p = .021\). Specifically, in
the high alignment conditions, the NPV trend was stronger in the high NPV
reliability condition than in the low NPV reliability condition,
\(M = -63.47\), 95\% CI \([-100.00,~-26.94]\), \(t(112) = -3.44\), \(p = .001\). In the low alignment
conditions, there was no significant difference between the two
reliability conditions, \(M = 4.35\), 95\% CI \([-34.52,~43.21]\), \(t(112) = 0.22\), \(p = .825\).
This shows that participants only used the NPV reliability information in their
allocation decisions when projects were similar, not when they were dissimilar.

The comparison with the no NPV condition revealed the expected pattern. For the
high alignment group, the linear NPV trend was significantly weaker in the no
NPV condition than in the high NPV reliability condition,
\(M = 75.70\), 95\% CI \([39.17,~112.24]\), \(t(112) = 4.11\), \(p < .001\), but not the low
NPV reliability condition, \(M = 12.24\), 95\% CI \([-27.94,~52.41]\), \(t(112) = 0.60\), \(p = .547\).
However, in the low alignment group, the linear NPV trend was significantly
weaker for the no NPV condition compared with both the low NPV reliability
condition, \(M = 64.63\), 95\% CI \([25.76,~103.50]\), \(t(112) = 3.29\), \(p = .001\),
and the high NPV reliability condition,
\(M = 60.29\), 95\% CI \([24.14,~96.43]\), \(t(112) = 3.30\), \(p = .001\).



\begin{figure}

In mixed factorial designs, error bars cannot be used to make inferences by ``eye'' across all conditions. Therefore, error bars are not included. Raw data are plotted in the background. When interpreting this figure, consider the linear trends in NPV.}\label{fig:plot-alignment-2-allocation}
\end{figure}

The mean ranking, confidence, and forecast data were all largely congruent with
the allocation findings (see Appendix~\ref{results-alignment-2-appendix}). The
results also show that the forecasts of those in the low alignment condition had
higher standard deviations than those in the high alignment condition (see
Appendix~\ref{forecast-sd-alignment-2}). However, this was not replicated in
subsequent experiments (see Appendices~\ref{forecast-sd-alignment-4}
and~\ref{forecast-sd-alignment-5}).

\subsection{Discussion}

Experiment~1 found evidence for the effect of project alignment on laypeople's
decision-making in capital allocation scenarios. Specifically, when projects
were comparable, participants used NPV when they were told that it was reliable, but
did not when they were told that it was unreliable. However, they used NPV
regardless of its reliability when it was the only shared dimension across products.

Experiment~1 manipulated \emph{verbal} NPV reliability. That is, participants were
explicitly told whether NPV was considered to be a reliable metric or not.
However, in the real-world the reliability of a metric is more commonly
expressed in numerical form, such as a range around an estimate. Experiment~2
attempted to replicate the alignment effects, while manipulating the \emph{numerical}
NPV reliability associated with each project, rather than the verbal reliability
as used in Experiment~1. Further, people with sufficient experience with
financial theory and analysis may be able to successfully draw inferences from
such information. Therefore, Experiment~2 used a sample of students enrolled in
a Master of Management degree, instead of the laypeople used in Experiment~1.

\hypertarget{alignment-3}{%
\section{Experiment~2}\label{alignment-3}}

Experiment~2 investigated the effects of project alignment and
numerically-expressed NPV reliability information on capital allocation
decisions. In Experiment~1, the information about NPV reliability level was
communicated explicitly (e.g., ``NPV is unreliable''). However, in Experiment~2,
only the actual NPV information itself was communicated without the conclusion
about its reliability. Specifically, participants were given a range of
predicted values (akin to a confidence interval). Therefore, while Experiment~1
manipulated \emph{verbal} NPV reliability, Experiment~2 manipulated \emph{numerical} NPV
reliability. Further, Experiment~2 included participants with more business
experience. This experiment tested whether the previous findings of an alignment
effect would be replicated using participants with more business experience. The
experiment also tested whether this population is sensitive to variance in
forecasts.

Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2} was again tested to
investigate the alignment effect in the new sample. However, the other
hypotheses tested in Experiment~1 were not retested because Experiment~2
manipulated numerical reliability and did not include a no NPV condition.
Research has shown that people are poor at reasoning with numerical variance
information \autocite{galesic2010,konold1993,vivalt2021,batteux2020}. Therefore,
Experiment~2 tested the following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[no effect of numerical reliability]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3} \iffalse (no effect of numerical reliability) \fi{} }The NPV \(\times\) reliability level interaction is not significant in either
alignment condition.
\end{hypothesis}

Experiment~2 also investigated the ability to quickly change participants'
understanding, if they did not initially use numerical NPV reliability in their
allocations. Therefore, participants were presented with a short lecture on the
importance of paying attention to variance in financial decision-making.
However, this lecture was not sufficient to inform participants' use of
numerical reliability (see Appendix~\ref{alignment-3-appendix}). Further,
Experiment~2 investigated whether participants would be over-confident in their
understanding of NPV \autocite[as in][]{long2018}. These results are also reported in
Appendix~\ref{alignment-3-appendix} because they are not highly relevant to
this chapter.

\hypertarget{method-alignment-2}{%
\subsection{Method}\label{method-alignment-2}}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Fifty-four participants (28 female) were recruited from a Master of Management degree at an Australian university. Age information was not recorded.~Both the reliability level (low and high) and
project alignment (low and high) conditions were presented to subjects, and the
order of presentation was counterbalanced.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Instructions}

Participants were shown similar instructions to those used in Experiment~1 (see
Section~\ref{instructions-materials-alignment-2}). However, they were given
more NPV information (including discount rate and initial investment).
Appendix~\ref{instructions-materials-alignment-3-appendix} shows the full
instructions.

\paragraph{NPV Test}

Participants were asked to complete a short, simple test to check their
understanding of NPV (see Appendix~\ref{npv-test-materials-alignment-3}).

\paragraph{Project Display}

As shown in Figures~\ref{fig:projects-alignment-low-materials-alignment-3}
and~\ref{fig:projects-alignment-high-materials-alignment-3}, projects were
displayed as they were in Experiment~1. However, a second set of projects with
different product types and descriptions was added to enable within-subjects
manipulation. Along with the single numerical NPV, participants were provided
with the forecasted cash flow ranges used to calculate the NPV. In the low NPV
reliability condition, ranges were \(\pm85\)\% around the mean (e.g., \$150--\$1,850
if forecast mean was \$1,000); while in the high NPV reliability condition,
ranges were \(\pm5\)\% around the mean (e.g., \$950--\$1,050 if the forecast mean was
\$1,000). A wide range indicated that the measure had low reliability, while a
narrow range indicated that the measure had high reliability. Participants were
told to treat each set of projects independently.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/projects-alignment-low-materials-alignment-3-1} \caption{An example of a low alignment, low reliability display in Experiment~2.}\label{fig:projects-alignment-low-materials-alignment-3}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/projects-alignment-high-materials-alignment-3-1} \caption{An example of a high alignment, high reliability display in Experiment~2.}\label{fig:projects-alignment-high-materials-alignment-3}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{NPV Knowledge Ratings}

Participants were asked to rate their confidence in knowledge of NPV at multiple
points in the experiment. Appendix~\ref{npv-knowledge-materials-alignment-3}
shows an example of this display.

\paragraph{Variance Lecture}

Participants were given a short lecture on the importance of paying attention to
variance information in an attempt to increase their use of numerical
reliability information in their allocations (see
Appendix~\ref{variance-lecture-materials-alignment-3} for more details and the
lecture slides).

\hypertarget{procedure-alignment-3}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-alignment-3}}

Participants were provided with the instructions and an explanation of NPV
before completing a simple test to demonstrate their understanding of NPV. They
then completed four counterbalanced capital allocation trials (one for each
condition combination) before viewing a brief presentation on the importance of
paying attention to variance in financial decision-making. Participants then
repeated two of the trials that they had completed earlier. They were shown the
allocation values they had provided earlier and were given the opportunity to
change them. Participants rated their knowledge of NPV before and after
completing the NPV test and then rated it again after completing the four
project displays. They were then asked to rate their knowledge of NPV before and
after the variance presentation.

\hypertarget{results-alignment-2}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-alignment-2}}

A within-subjects factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of
NPV, project alignment, and numerical NPV reliability on participants' project
allocations (see Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-3-allocation}). The alignment
\(\times\) NPV reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was significant,
\(F(2.81, 148.75) = 3.95\), \(p = .011\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .069\).
However, this appeared to be driven by the difference between alignment
conditions in the interaction between the quadratic NPV trend and NPV
reliability level,
\(\Delta M = -42.28\), 95\% CI \([-76.96,~-7.59]\), \(t(53) = -3.14\), \(p = .011\), even after
applying a \v{S}idák correction. The same interaction but using a the linear NPV
trend was not significant,
\(\Delta M = -6.13\), 95\% CI \([-31.50,~19.25]\), \(t(53) = -0.62\), \(p = .954\). Further, the linear
NPV trend did not differ between the reliability level conditions in either the
low alignment condition, \(\Delta M = -3.19\), 95\% CI \([-18.77,~12.40]\), \(t(53) = -0.41\), \(p = .683\)
or the high alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = 2.94\), 95\% CI \([-12.63,~18.52]\), \(t(53) = 0.38\), \(p = .706\). However, averaged
across reliability level, the linear NPV trend was stronger in the low alignment
condition than in the high alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = 28.19\), 95\% CI \([5.57,~50.81]\), \(t(53) = 2.50\), \(p = .016\). This suggests that
participants relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar compared with when
they were similar.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-alignment-3-allocation-1} \caption{Mean allocation across NPV, by project alignment and reliability level conditions. Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals, calculated from the within-subjects standard errors using the method from \textcite{cousineau2014}. Raw data are plotted in the background.}\label{fig:plot-alignment-3-allocation}
\end{figure}

The ranking data were congruent with these results, while the confidence data
were less so. Further, the findings on over-confidence from \textcite[Study~1]{long2018}
were not replicated with NPV knowledge, and the variance lecture did not
facilitate participants' use of numerical reliability information. These
analyses are reported in Appendix~\ref{results-alignment-3-appendix}.

\subsection{Discussion}

Based on participants with real-world business experience, Experiment 2
replicated the alignment effect found in Experiment 1. That is, participants
relied more on NPV when faced with a set of dissimilar projects than when faced
with similar projects, supporting
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2}. Experiment~2 also found
evidence for Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3}, with
no significant differences between the numerical reliability conditions. While
Experiment~2 did not replicate the interaction found in Experiment~1, it should
be emphasised that these are two different effects. In Experiment~1,
participants were explicitly told whether the NPV measure was reliable, while in
Experiment~2, they were provided with variance information that merely implied
NPV reliability. Thus, the results of Experiment~2 show that business students
were affected by the comparability of projects but not by numerical NPV
reliability information. Specifically, participants appeared to focus only on
the NPV itself for a specific project, not on the underlying noisiness of the
measure.

The participants in Experiment~2 seemed to rely on NPV more than those in
Experiment~1. This was seen by the steeper linear trends in Experiment~2. This
discrepancy may be due to the difference in domain experience and exposure to
financial metrics in formal study. However, the extra explanation and testing of
NPV for the management students may have also increased its salience. In sum,
the Experiment~2 sample showed clearer trends of NPV reliance, but importantly
was still affected by similarity even when it was manipulated within-subjects.

Experiment~1 tested NPV reliability expressed verbally, while Experiment~2
tested NPV reliability expressed numerically. However, the difference in
findings was confounded by the different populations that were sampled. Further,
in both experiments, the business projects consisted of a limited number of
domains. It is unclear to what extent these specific domains influenced the
results. These projects were centred around consumer products, which were chosen
to be more easily accessible to participants without business experience.
However, the individual features of a project do not necessarily indicate its
profitability. For instance, a laptop with a low storage capacity may be more
profitable than one with a high storage capacity because of consumer goods
markets. Experiment~3 addressed these limitations.

Another limitation of Experiments~1 and~2 was the potential confounding effect
of presentation style. The two alignment conditions differed in the number of
alignable differences, but also in the way that the information was presented.
The information in the low alignment condition was presented as paragraphs,
while the information in the high alignment condition was presented as a table.
While it is likely that these data types would be presented in this way in the
business setting, it is important to rule out that this difference did not
unnecessarily increase task difficulty. Therefore, Experiment~3 attempted to
replicate this effect while controlling for presentation style

\hypertarget{alignment-8}{%
\section{Experiment~3}\label{alignment-8}}

Experiment~3 investigated the effects of project alignment, NPV, NPV reliability
type and NPV reliability level on participants' budget allocations. Experiment~1
manipulated NPV reliability level using verbal prompts. That is, participants
were explicitly told whether or not NPV was reliable for a certain project.
Experiment~2 investigated whether people were able to extract the same
reliability information using numerical prompts. That is, participants were
provided with NPVs with either wide or narrow ranges, indicating either low or
high reliability, respectively. Moreover, given that laypeople were sampled for
Experiment~1, and Master of Management students were sampled for Experiment~2,
it was not possible to compare the two reliability types (verbal and numerical)
without ruling out the potential confounding effect of population type. Thus,
similar to Experiments~1 and~2, Experiment~3 manipulated project alignment, NPV
and NPV reliability level but also added reliability type. Further, presentation
style was a possible confounding factor in the previous experiments. That is,
projects in the high alignment condition were always displayed in a table, while
projects in the low alignment condition were always displayed as paragraphs.
This possible confounder was excluded in Experiment~3 by using the same
presentation style for both alignment conditions.

In Experiment~3, the expected results for the verbal reliability condition
replicated those of Experiment~1. The numerical reliability condition may
replicate the findings of Experiment~2. However, a pilot experiment (detailed in
Appendix~\ref{alignment-7}) found no significant differences between numerical
reliability conditions. Appendix~\ref{alignment-8-appendix} shows a simulation
of the hypothesised effects, with the numerical reliability effects based on the
findings of the pilot experiment. Therefore, Experiment~3 retested
Hypotheses~\ref{hyp:three-way-alignment-2},~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2},~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2},~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2},
and~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2} for the verbal reliability
condition, but was agnostic between whether the numerical reliability condition
will look more like the pattern found in the pilot experiment or the pattern
found in Experiment~2.

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Four hundred and forty-eight participants (176 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 41.65 years (\emph{SD} = 10.3, \emph{min.} = 29, \emph{max.} = 78). Participants reported an average of 6.94 years (\emph{SD} = 8.23, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 43) working in a business setting, and an average of 3.73 years (\emph{SD} = 6.27, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 45) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 11.35 min (\emph{SD} = 10.79, \emph{min.} = 1.92, \emph{max.} = 183.7).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-alignment-8}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions. The two
reliability level conditions (low and high) were presented within subjects and
the order of their presentation was randomised. Similar to the previous
experiments, NPV varied within subjects. Therefore, each participant saw two
separate project displays. Appendix~\ref{power-analysis-alignment-8} describes
the power analysis conducted to arrive at the sample size.

\end{tabular}

\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Instructions}

Participants were given instructions similar to those in the previous
experiments, with an added explanation about the NPV reliability information for
each reliability type (see
Appendix~\ref{instructions-materials-alignment-8-appendix}). Further, they
completed a test of basic NPV understanding. Further, they completed a test on
basic NPV understanding, which also functioned as an attention check.

\paragraph{Project Display}

The project displays were similar to those used in the previous experiments.
However, participants were given the same presentation style for both alignment
conditions. Each display had a table describing the projects in the set,
including ranking and allocation inputs. Project details were presented as
bullet points within the relevant cells of the table.
Figure~\ref{fig:projects-alignment-low-reliability-explicit-low-materials-alignment-8}
shows an example of a low alignment, low verbal reliability display; and
Figure~\ref{fig:projects-alignment-high-reliability-implicit-high-materials-alignment-8}
shows an example of a high alignment, high numerical reliability display.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/projects-alignment-low-reliability-explicit-low-materials-alignment-8-1} \caption{An example of a low alignment, low verbal reliability display in Experiment~3.}\label{fig:projects-alignment-low-reliability-explicit-low-materials-alignment-8}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/projects-alignment-high-reliability-implicit-high-materials-alignment-8-1} \caption{An example of a high alignment, high numerical reliability display in Experiment~3.}\label{fig:projects-alignment-high-reliability-implicit-high-materials-alignment-8}
\end{figure}

Three elements were counterbalanced: (a) the association between reliability
level and project set (two variations), (b) the association between business
name and NPV (five latin square variations), and (c) project variation (five
variations per alignment condition). When counterbalancing for the high
alignment group, projects varied by project type (e.g., whether the five
projects all described oil wells or microchips). When counterbalancing for the
low alignment group, projects varied by their intrinsic features (e.g., whether
the oil well project in the set indicated a probability of finding oil of 96\% or
90\%). Table column order and project display order were both randomised.

\paragraph{Interstitial Page}

Prior to each project being displayed, participants were shown an interstitial
page, which was used to (a) introduce the next display, and (b) check the
participant's attention (given that no input was required, participants could
easily skip the page without reading the text). See
Appendix~\ref{interstitial-materials-alignment-8} for an example.

\subsection{Results}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV, project
alignment, NPV reliability level, and NPV reliability type on participants'
project allocations (see Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-8-allocation} for the
main results and Appendix~\ref{results-alignment-8-allocation} for the
remainder of the hypothesised allocation effects). The four-way interaction
(alignment \(\times\) reliability level \(\times\) NPV \(\times\) reliability type)
was not significant, \(F(3.20, 1,420.19) = 0.71\), \(p = .555\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .002\). Regardless,
the primary hypotheses were supported.

\subsubsection{Verbal Reliability}

The three-way interaction (alignment \(\times\) reliability level \(\times\) NPV
amount) in the verbal reliability condition was not significant,
\(\Delta M = 13.42\), 95\% CI \([-1.27,~28.11]\), \(t(444) = 1.80\), \(p = .073\). This is
because NPV reliability level interacted with NPV in both alignment conditions.
This is a different pattern from Experiment~1 where there was no effect of NPV
reliability level in the low alignment condition. In the high alignment
condition, the interaction between the linear NPV trend and NPV reliability
level was significant,
\(\Delta M = -36.63\), 95\% CI \([-47.02,~-26.25]\), \(t(444) = -6.93\), \(p < .001\).
Specifically, the trend was stronger for the high reliability condition,
\(\Delta M = 27.26\), 95\% CI \([17.69,~36.83]\), \(t(444) = 5.60\), \(p < .001\),
compared with the low reliability condition,
\(\Delta M = -9.38\), 95\% CI \([-18.86,~0.11]\), \(t(444) = -1.94\), \(p = .053\).
This shows that, similar to Experiment~1, participants' allocations depended on
verbally expressed NPV reliability. In low alignment, there was also an
interaction between the linear NPV trend and NPV reliability level,
\(\Delta M = -23.21\), 95\% CI \([-33.60,~-12.83]\), \(t(444) = -4.39\), \(p < .001\).
This suggests that allocations also depended on verbal reliability in the low
alignment condition.

However, another aspect of the data suggests a greater use of NPV in the low
alignment condition. The linear NPV trend was stronger in the low
alignment condition than in the high alignment condition when averaged over
reliability level,
\(\Delta M = 28.97\), 95\% CI \([17.68,~40.26]\), \(t(444) = 5.04\), \(p < .001\). This
suggests that when NPV reliability was expressed verbally, similar to
Experiment~1, participants relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar than
when they were similar.

Overall, participants used NPV less when it was described as less reliable in
both high and low alignment conditions, and further, used NPV more when projects
were less alignable regardless of how reliable NPV was described to be.

\subsubsection{Numerical Reliability}

The numerical reliability data were analysed differently to the verbal
reliability data because the effects of interest here were the alignment and
reliability level effects. The linear NPV trend was stronger in the low
alignment condition, averaged over reliability level (with Bonferroni
adjustment),
\(\Delta M = 15.19\), 95\% CI \([0.78,~29.60]\), \(t(444) = 2.64\), \(p = .034\). This
pattern was the same as that found for the verbal reliability condition above
and in Experiment~2. Further, the linear NPV trend was not significantly
different between the reliability level conditions for both the low alignment
condition,
\(\Delta M = 1.64\), 95\% CI \([-11.61,~14.90]\), \(t(444) = 0.31\), \(p > .999\),
and high alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = -1.21\), 95\% CI \([-14.46,~12.05]\), \(t(444) = -0.23\), \(p > .999\).
This indicates that participants did not use numerical NPV reliability to inform
their allocations.



\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-alignment-8-allocation-1} \caption{Mean allocation across NPV, by alignment, reliability level, and reliability type conditions. Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals, calculated from the within-subjects standard errors using the method from \textcite{cousineau2014}. Raw data are plotted in the background.}\label{fig:plot-alignment-8-allocation}
\end{figure}

Similar to the verbal reliability condition, the use of NPV was stronger in the
low alignment condition than it was in the high alignment condition. However,
unlike the verbal reliability condition, allocations did not depend on numerical
reliability in either the low or the high alignment condition. In the verbal
reliability condition, allocations depended on NPV reliability level in both
alignment conditions.

\subsection{Discussion}

Hypotheses~\ref{hyp:three-way-alignment-2},~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2},~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2},
and~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2} were supported in the
verbal reliability condition. This shows that, while overall participants
preferred to use NPV as a proxy for project quality in their allocations, they
still used verbal reliability information. Specifically, when projects were
similar, participants used NPV when they were told that it was reliable, and
used alternative metrics when told that it was not reliable. However, in
Experiment~3, no support was found for
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2}. It was expected that
participants in the low alignment condition would use NPV regardless of the
reliability level conditions, as in Experiment~1. Rather, they used NPV less
when told that it was unreliable. However, they primarily used NPV overall, as
shown by the positive NPV trend in both reliability level conditions.

Further, Experiment~3 replicated the finding of Experiment~2 for the numerical
reliability condition. Specifically, participants relied more on NPV when
projects were dissimilar but, critically, did not use numerical range
information to influence their allocations. A pilot study (documented in
Appendix~\ref{alignment-7}) replicated the results of Experiment~1 in the
verbal reliability condition, but did not replicate the results of Experiment~2
in the numerical reliability condition. That is, when faced with numerical
ranges as the NPV reliability information, participants did not even use the
midpoint in their decisions. The results of Experiment~3 suggest that the
finding in the pilot experiment may have been spurious or due to an unexplored
component of the experimental design, but this can only be deteremined with
future research.

\section{General Discussion}

Across three experiments there were two main findings: (a) NPV is used more when
options are difficult to compare in the low alignment conditions; and (b) people
do not consider numerical variance information, despite this being important to
the reliability of the NPV forecasts. This pattern with numerical reliability
information contrasted with the frequent use of verbal indicators of reliability
level. This numerical variance neglect is surprising, since other work showed
that people can readily extract variance information when experiencing numerical
sequences \autocite{rosenbaum2020}. Both the verbal and numerical effects were
consistent for both naive and experienced participants, indicating their
persistence. People make use of metrics with alignable differences when required
to compare disparate options. However, they do not always use alternative
metrics, even when they are available.

Experiment~1 found that participants did not use NPV in their allocation
decisions when they were told that it was unreliable but did use it when told it
was reliable. Experiment~2 found that participants with some business experience
relied more on NPV for capital allocation when the rest of the information was
non-alignable compared with when it was alignable. However, they did not take
into account numerical reliability information when making these decisions.
Experiment~3 found further evidence of these effects within one experimental
design.

Alignable differences have been shown to be important into decision-making in
many settings \autocite{markman2010,markman1995}. The experiments presented in this
chapter are novel in terms of the effects of project alignment on capital
allocation. Further, these experiments considered the extent to which the
reliability of an alignable measure (NPV) affects the way in which it is used.
This depended on the availability of other alignable differences in the set of
choices. If other alignable differences were available, then participants were
willing to reduce their use of a reportedly unreliable alignable measure (or use
it when told that it was reliable). However, when no other alignable differences
were available, then the alignable, albeit unreliable, measure was more likely
to be used. This was found in both Experiments~1 and~3, as well as in a pilot
study to a lesser extent (reported in Appendix~\ref{alignment-1}).

Financial measures such as NPV are useful because of their alignability. That
is, they may serve as an alignable difference, regardless of the inherent
similarities between a set of projects. Psychologically, these measures are
useful because they allow for relevant inferences \autocite{lassaline1996} and because
they offer an abstraction of concrete details \autocite{doumas2013}. However, the
structural alignment account does not directly speak to real-world implications
when there is a need for non-alignable comparisons. NPV is a type of abstraction
that facilitates the comparison of different aspects of a company. For instance,
the use of NPV may facilitate the comparison of an oil field project with a
refinery project. However, this increased alignment could actually hide
important information because it does not consider the finer complexities
inherent in each business unit. The forecasts used to calculate NPV for each
business unit are based on different indicators, and there are likely to be
differences between each unit's estimates. Thus, one can imagine a continuum of
comparisons in which the usefulness of comparison increases with the level of
alignability but depends on the level of abstraction that is required to achieve
the alignment.

The finding that participants, even those with some business experience, did not
sufficiently consider variance information is surprising but understandable. It
is surprising because financial decision-making largely depends on the
consideration of different sources of variance (e.g., risk, volatility, and
uncertainty). At the same time, it is understandable because research from
psychology and statistics education shows that statistics students and people in
general have a poor ability to draw statistical inferences \autocites[e.g.,][]{galesic2010,konold1993}. Future research should investigate the conditions under which
individuals' sensitivity to variance information may be facilitated. For
instance, it is unclear whether it is merely salience that is lacking, meaning
that visual aids could be useful, or whether a further explicit explanation of
statistical inference is necessary. The findings of a pilot experiment suggest
that participants struggle to use numerical NPV reliability information, even
when given explicit instructions (see Appendix~\ref{alignment-6}).

A possible limitation of these experiments is the use of NPV as the only
financial metric. In the business world, there are many metrics that serve
similar functions and are used as tools to deal with non-alignable options.
Therefore, future research should attempt to replicate the current findings
using different financial measures.

Future research should also investigate the boundary conditions of the
reliability type effect. That is, people appear to respond to explicit
reliability information but not to variance information that only implies
reliability. Future research should attempt to identify the minimal variance
information that participants need to understand the relevant implications for
reliability. Participants may simply not notice the variance information or
assume that it is irrelevant. For instance, future research could test
participants in a condition in which the variance information is more salient.

\chapter{Seeking Alignment in Past Cases}\label{interstitial-2}}

Chapter~\ref{alignment} found that people do not sufficiently perceive the
importance of numerical variance information in capital allocation. This is
important when business projects are dissimilar because people may fail to pay
attention to the differing variance underlying NPV across different domains.
However, there are also implications for high alignment scenarios. When projects
are alignable, managers are likely to be able to use abstract metrics as well as
intrinsic project features. Managers may use a metric such as NPV, the variance
of which may suggest a lack of reliability, despite being able to use intrinsic
project features. Therefore, they may miss the opportunity to use different and
potentially more reliable measures.

Therefore, the evaluation of a non-alignable set of projects has many potential
pitfalls. This situation is likely to occur in most hierarchical organisations,
especially those that are highly diversified. As discussed in
Chapter~\ref{interstitial-1}, a solution for managers who fail to aggregate the
risk of multiple projects may be for them to concurrently evaluate projects as a
portfolio. However, the solution to the evaluation of dissimilar projects in
diversified organisations is likely to involve significantly more difficult
structural changes in the organisation. For instance, this may mean divesting
certain divisions of the organisation, as GE has done in the last few years
\autocite{scott2018}.

Other solutions are also possible. For instance, organisations may develop a
more normative use of metrics and take into account underlying uncertainties.
However, this change may require substantially more statistical reasoning
abilities than should be expected of managers without better decision-making
guidelines. Another solution for managers is to seek evidence from similar
projects from outside of the organisation. This may be useful because a
diversified organisation may not have enough points of reference for a project
proposal. It would also mean that substantial organisational restructuring such
as divestment or training managers in statistical reasoning would not be
required.

Evidence from similar projects may come in the form of an individual case study
from another organisation or a research report that describes a statistical
result. Case studies are especially important in managerial decision-making
because they are used extensively in business school teaching materials.
Therefore, managers are likely to seek case studies that may be used to inform
their decisions. However, do they believe that a single case study is more
useful than statistical data? The literature on anecdotal bias suggests that
they might. Chapter~\ref{anecdotes} considers the influence of anecdotes on
project allocation when they conflict with statistical evidence.

Previous work shows that people often do not give evidence appropriate weighting
in their decisions \autocite{griffin1992}. Statistical and anecdotal evidence often
conflict because statistical estimates commonly refer to the mean value of a
distribution, while individual cases may be sampled from either tail of the
distribution. This comparison may produce conflicting information, especially if
the distribution is skewed; therefore, it is important to appropriately weigh
their influence when making a decision. In the same way that intrinsic project
features conflicted with the abstract financial metrics in
Chapter~\ref{alignment}, anecdotal evidence conflicts with financial metrics of
the target project in Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}.

Chapter~\ref{anecdotes} considers how people deal with such conflicting
information. That is, do they focus on one metric or use a trade-off? In the
previous chapter, participants did not appear to predominantly use any one
specific cue. The fact that those in the low alignment condition relied more on
NPV compared with those in the high alignment condition means that the latter
were still referring to intrinsic project features to some extent. Specifically,
the influence of different measures may have been integrated in a type of
trade-off. However, there was no clear way of determining this because the
allocation measure was aggregated in the analysis. In Chapter~\ref{anecdotes},
however, conditions are set up so that it is possible to determine whether
participants were using anecdotes exclusively, partially, or not at all.

\section{Introduction}

A good story is often more persuasive than data. While usually harmless in daily
settings, poor judgement arising from a bias towards anecdotal evidence can lead
to large-scale negative consequences. Perhaps the most prominent example of such
an error in judgement is the belief that a vaccine causes a certain disorder
based on isolated stories, despite contradictory scientific evidence. An
analogous error exists in settings such as managerial decision-making. In
business, managers use analogies, known as \emph{case studies}, as a part of their
strategic decision-making. Case studies are examples of previous situations
considered similar by the decision-maker and are used to draw inferences about a
target problem. Case studies are known as \emph{anecdotes} when comparing them with
aggregated data.

Many businesses use case studies to inform their decisions but often struggle to
use them successfully \autocite{gavetti2005a}. This may be attributable to the
prominence of companies that are either highly successful or highly
unsuccessful. That is, people are often uninterested in average outcomes but are
captivated by both positive and negative extreme outcomes. The increased
salience of an anecdote may increase its influence over that of useful
statistical data. Further, increased anecdotal salience may also shift attention
away from structural similarities in favour of more surface similarities. Both
of these issues may explain the unsuccessful use of case studies.

The first consideration when using a case study is its merit relative to
available aggregated statistical data. That is, if the case study is a single
data point in a set of other relevant cases, then using the statistical
properties of the larger sample is more inferentially informative than using a
single case from within the sample (unlike perhaps when the single case is
somehow the most relevant example from the sample). Despite the utility and
availability of large sample data, research has shown that people often prefer
anecdotal evidence over statistical data \autocite{reinard1988,shen2015,jaramillo2019,freling2020}.

However, if this larger sample is not available (or is ignored), then the second
consideration when using a case study is the extent of its similarity to the
target problem. Research on the psychology of similarity judgements
distinguishes between surface and relational similarity \autocite{gentner1983}. The
consensus of this research is that the more conceptual structures that two cases
share, the more useful they are in decision-making \autocite{markman1995,lassaline1996}. Therefore, case studies that are similar to a target problem on
a merely surface level are less useful than those that are related through a
shared conceptual structure.

Previous research has considered the role of similarity and analogical reasoning
in business-related decision-making \autocite[e.g.,][]{gavetti2005}. Others have
investigated the influence of anecdotes in capital allocation decisions and the
impact of anecdote similarity on their persuasiveness (summarised below).
However, it is unclear to what extent an anecdote's similarity to the target
problem will affect its influence on capital allocation decisions. Further, it
is unclear whether people will be sensitive to information about the
distribution from which the anecdote was sampled.

\subsection{Anecdotal Bias}

Anecdotal bias refers to the influence of anecdotal evidence over statistical
evidence on people's beliefs. Journalists, for instance, are well aware of the
power of anecdotes. An analysis of approximately 29,000 New York Times
editorials showed a reliance on anecdotes to drive arguments \autocite{alkhatib2017}.
While some studies have concluded that statistics are more persuasive than
anecdotes \autocites[e.g.,][]{allen1997,hornikx2005,hoeken2001} and others provided more
cautious conclusions \autocite{winterbottom2008}, a number have found evidence for
anecdotal bias \autocites[e.g.,][]{reinard1988,shen2015,jaramillo2019,ratcliff2020,reinhart2006}. \textcite{zebregs2015} suggest that this disparity in findings might be
attributable to statistics affecting beliefs and attitudes, and anecdotes
affecting intention. A more recent meta-analysis of 61 studies found that,
overall, statistical evidence is more persuasive than anecdotal evidence
\autocite{freling2020}. However, even if statistical evidence is more persuasive
overall, anecdotes that add no additional information to co-presented statistics
may still influence people's judgement \autocite{jaramillo2019}. Further, the
meta-analysis found that people tend to prefer anecdotal evidence over
statistical data when the stakes are more emotional, medical, or relevant to the
decision-maker. In business, decisions are clearly relevant to the
decision-maker.

\subsection{Anecdotal Bias in Business}

It is important to investigate anecdotal bias in business because of its
implications for managers' use of case studies. There are many cases of managers
successfully using analogies from anecdotal cases but also of failures to
analogise correctly \autocite{gavetti2005,gavetti2005a}. There is very little research
on anecdotal bias in business, but the existing work finds clear evidence of the
effect. In fact, the recent meta-analysis by \textcite{freling2020} included the work of
\textcite{wainberg2013} as one such paper.

\textcite{wainberg2013} gave a sample of managers and other professionals a choice between
two audit firms, which varied in terms of their audit deficiencies for various
clients. The experiment was designed in such a way that the statistical evidence
favoured one firm, while the anecdotal evidence favoured the other firm.
Participants were allocated to one of five conditions. Participants in the
\emph{anecdotes only} condition were given anecdotal examples of firm deficiencies,
while those in the \emph{anecdotes \& statistics} condition were given the same
anecdotal examples as well as the number of clients and deficiencies found.
However, participants were not explicitly provided with the proportions of these
values. Participants in the \emph{statistics only} condition were given this
proportions information as well as the number of clients without deficiencies
but no detailed examples of deficiencies. The \emph{anecdotes \& enhanced statistics}
condition included both anecdotes and the information in the statistics only
condition. The terminology here is confusing because nothing about the way the
statistics are presented to the participants is ``enhanced'' beyond how they are
presented in the statistics only condition. However, the \emph{anecdotes \& enhanced
statistics---judgment orientation} condition emphasised the importance of
proportions and keeping absolute numbers in context.

\textcite{wainberg2013} measured the percentage of participants who chose firms favoured
by the statistical data, finding evidence of anecdotal bias. Participants in the
anecdotes only and anecdotes \& statistics conditions equally chose the firm
favoured by statistical data. However, participants in the anecdotes \& enhanced
statistics condition were less likely to choose this firm compared with those in
the statistics only condition, even when the underlying proportions were made
explicit. This shows evidence of anecdotal bias because participants ignored
contradictory statistical data. The lack of difference between the anecdotes \&
statistics condition and the anecdotes only condition implies that the anecdotal
bias effect was ``complete.'' That is, the presented statistics did not play a
role in influencing participants' choice of firm. A ``partial'' effect would have
occurred if more participants in the anecdotes \& statistics condition had chosen
the firm compared with participants in the anecdotes only condition. This would
have meant that statistics played at least some role in influencing choice.

The other important finding in this work is that anecdotal bias was reduced by
highlighting relevant statistical features and providing an explanation of
statistical inference. This is important because it suggests that potential
psychological biases can be reduced with a reframing of provided information and
an explanation of relevant statistical concepts.

\textcite{wainberg2018} conducted a similar study to that of \textcite{wainberg2013} but with a
capital budgeting task as opposed to a binary choice. Participants had to choose
between three production line machines for a mid-sized company that prints
circuit boards. The statistical data suggested that Machine~A was better than
Machine~B, and Machine~B was better than Machine~C. Participants were given only
statistical information or statistical information along with an anecdote. The
anecdote was in the form of an email from a colleague who recommended against
Machine~A (the best option). Similar to \textcite{wainberg2013}, participants were
assigned to \emph{anecdote \& statistics} and \emph{statistics only} conditions. In the
\emph{judgement orientation I} and \emph{judgement orientation II} conditions,
participants were told to ``think like a scientist'' and received either a short
or a long explanation, respectively, of the importance of statistical inference.

\textcite{wainberg2018} found evidence for anecdotal bias. Including a contradictory
anecdote alongside statistical evidence (the anecdote \& statistics condition)
reduced the proportion of participants who chose Machine~A. The study also found
that the addition of instructions that emphasised scientific thinking reduced
this bias. Unlike \textcite{wainberg2013}, \textcite{wainberg2018} could not determine whether the
anecdotal bias was a complete or partial because there was no anecdote only
condition. Further, neither work considered the effect of the anecdote's
similarity to the target problem.

\hypertarget{effect-of-similarity}{%
\subsection{Effect of Similarity}\label{effect-of-similarity}}

Arguably, the extent of one's reliance on an anecdote should depend on its
similarity to the target problem. Previous work has examined the importance of
weighting previous cases according to their similarity to the present situation
\autocite{gilboa1995,lovallo2012}. For instance, consider a medical treatment with
contradictory statistical and anecdotal evidence; that is, a large-scale
aggregated study has found that the treatment has 99\% efficacy, while someone
reports on social media that they became sick as a side-effect of the treatment.
While the decision to use the treatment should be informed more by the
aggregated data than by the anecdotal data, an individual may have reason to be
concerned if the person who became sick was their identical twin. Therefore, the
inference that the individual may also need to be cautious about the treatment
arises from a specific causal model based on the shared genetics of the two
cases.

There have been mixed results regarding the effect of anecdote similarity on the
extent of anecdotal bias. \textcite[Study~3]{hoeken2009} found evidence for the effect of
similarity on anecdotal bias for a variety of claims. As well as manipulating
whether participants received a claim supported by anecdotal or statistical
evidence, they manipulated whether the anecdotal evidence was similar or
dissimilar to the claim that it was supporting. They found that similar
anecdotes were more persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes. Using a student
sample, \textcite{hoeken2001} did not find evidence for the effect of similarity to a
local government proposal. Similarly, \textcite{hornikx2018} considered the effect of
similarity on anecdotal bias in local government policy decision-making. The
researchers did not find an effect for similarity or for anecdotes. However,
they measured persuasiveness, and it may be that requiring participants to make
more concrete decisions will create a more realistic scenario.

Apart from the need to determine the effect of similarity on the anecdotal bias
effect, it is important to clarify how such an effect might work. Research on
analogical reasoning has distinguished between simple surface similarity and
deeper relational similarity \autocite{gentner1983}. As mentioned above, one's use of an
anecdote should depend on the extent to which it is associated by an underlying
causal mechanism or mere surface similarity. Imagine a manager of a
multi-divisional company deciding on the allocation of capital between an oil
well project and a technology project. Would hearing of a recent failed oil well
project at another company influence the manager's allocation decision? If so,
would it influence the manager's decision because the anecdote has similarities
to the target oil well project (surface similarity)? Or would the manager seek
out the underlying reason for the failure of the other company's oil well
project to identify whether it is relevant to the target oil project (relational
similarity)? The experiments presented in this chapter investigated whether the
anecdotal bias effect arose from causal inductive reasoning or merely the
surface similarity with the target project.

\subsection{Experiment Summary}

Experiment~1 investigated whether anecdotal bias in a capital allocation
paradigm depends on anecdote similarity. Further, it tested whether providing
additional statistical information encourages participants to consider the
statistics over the anecdote. Experiment~1 used a negative anecdote, which is an
example of an unsuccessful case. This kind of anecdote has been shown to produce
anecdotal bias in both medical \autocite{jaramillo2019} and business \autocite{wainberg2018}
decision-making. However, \textcite{jaramillo2019} found less bias in positive anecdotes,
which are examples of successful cases, and \textcite{wainberg2018} did not consider these
at all. Therefore, Experiment~2 attempted to replicate the effect of similarity
on anecdotal bias using a positive anecdote. Further, Experiment~2 provided
participants with information about the sample distribution of the anecdote,
whereas Experiment~1 did not. This allowed for an informal test of whether
people are sensitive to such information.

\hypertarget{anecdotes-1}{%
\section{Experiment~1}\label{anecdotes-1}}

Experiment~1 investigated the effects of anecdote similarity and bias on
capital allocation. Participants were assigned to the same conditions as those
in \textcite{wainberg2018} except that an anecdote only condition was included and the
judgement orientation I condition was excluded. They were then asked to allocate
a hypothetical budget between two business projects. Participants were also
presented with a case study that was either similar or dissimilar to the target
project (but still from the same industry). Further, for the conditions in which
statistical evidence was provided, participants were presented with aggregated
information about the success of similar projects in the form of NPV as well as
a reliability measure. One project was clearly better than the other in terms of
the statistical data, but the anecdotal evidence suggested the opposite.

Previous research has found that people are persuaded more by negative anecdotes
than by positive statistical data in capital allocation scenarios
\autocite{wainberg2018}. While studies have shown that similar anecdotes are more
persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes \autocite[Study~3]{hoeken2009}, it is unclear how
the anecdotal bias effect may depend on anecdote similarity. Thus, the main
question is whether anecdotal bias will be greater when the anecdote is similar
to the target project compared with when it is dissimilar. The target project
was supported by the statistics but was inconsistent with the anecdotes.
Further, Experiment~1 only used negative anecdotes. Therefore, the experiment
would show evidence of anecdotal bias if participants assigned to the statistics
only condition allocated more money to the target project compared with those in
the anecdote \& statistics condition. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the
following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[anecdotal bias depends on the similarity of negative anecdotes]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1} \iffalse (anecdotal bias depends on the similarity of negative anecdotes) \fi{} }Budget allocations to the target project will be higher when statistics only are
presented compared with when statistics are accompanied by an anecdote with high
similarity to the target project. In addition, budget allocations will not be
affected by anecdotes with low similarity. That is, the statistics only
condition will not differ from the low-similarity anecdote \& statistics
condition.
\end{hypothesis}

Experiment~1 predicted that that the anecdotal bias effect will be complete, as
in \textcite{wainberg2013}. Specifically, the participants presented with the
high-similarity anecdote along with the statistics would not use any statistical
information. Testing the high similarity condition will provide an equivalent
test to that of \textcite{wainberg2013}. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the following:

\begin{hypothesis}[effect of statistics for negative anecdotes]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1} \iffalse (effect of statistics for negative anecdotes) \fi{} }Participants in the high-similarity anecdote \& statistics condition (without the
enhanced statistics explanation) and those in the high-similarity anecdote only
condition will allocate capital equally to the target project.
\end{hypothesis}

Participants with additional information on the importance of scientific
thinking and statistical data may be less affected by anecdotes. \textcite{wainberg2018}
termed this the \emph{judgement orientation II} condition, while in this experiment
it is termed the \emph{anecdote \& enhanced statistics condition}. Unlike the anecdote
\& enhanced statistics condition in \textcite{wainberg2013}, the statistical information
here is actually ``enhanced'' because of the accompanying text. Experiment~1
tested whether the effect of additional information on anecdotal bias would be
replicated in a capital allocation scenario. Therefore, Experiment~1 tested the
following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[effect of enhanced statistics for negative anecdotes]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1} \iffalse (effect of enhanced statistics for negative anecdotes) \fi{} }Participants in the high-similarity anecdote \& enhanced statistics condition
will allocate more capital to the target project than those in the
high-similarity anecdote \& statistics condition.
\end{hypothesis}

\subsection{Method}\label{method-anecdotes-1}}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Two hundred and eighty-four participants (197 female) were recruited from a cohort of psychology undergraduates at The University of Sydney. Participants were compensated with course credit. The average age was 20.84 years (\emph{SD} = 4.93, \emph{min.} = 18, \emph{max.} = 58). Participants reported an average of 1.68 years (\emph{SD} = 3.63, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 32) working in a business setting, and an average of 0.81 years (\emph{SD} = 1.57, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 12) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 22.24 min (\emph{SD} = 97.45, \emph{min.} = 1.67, \emph{max.} = 1,101.48).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-anecdotes-1}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions.
Appendix~\ref{power-analysis-anecdotes-1} describes the power analysis
conducted to arrive at this sample size.

\hypertarget{instructions-materials-anecdotes-1}{%
\paragraph{Instructions}\label{instructions-materials-anecdotes-1}}

All participants were first shown general instructions explaining the task.
Subsequent instructions shown to participants depended on their experimental
condition. Those in the anecdote only condition were told that they would be
shown a case study of a failed project and an analysis of why it failed. Those
in the statistics only condition were told that they would be shown NPV and
reliability information for two focal projects. They were told that these values
were sourced from a study with a large sample. Those in the anecdote \&
statistics condition were shown both of these instructions and were also told
that the information in the anecdote had been included in the aggregated study
data. Those in the anecdote \& enhanced statistics condition were shown the same
instructions as those in the anecdote \& statistics condition, but were also
provided with the explanation of scientific thinking used by \textcite{wainberg2018}.
Appendix~\ref{instructions-materials-anecdotes-1-appendix} shows the
instructions used in Experiment~1.

\paragraph{Allocation Task}

In the allocation task, participants were asked to allocate a hypothetical
budget to one of two projects from two different businesses. In this chapter,
these projects are referred to as the \emph{focal} projects, with one being the
\emph{target} project and the other the \emph{comparison} project. The target project was
used as the reference for the similarity manipulation. That is, the anecdote was
either high or low in similarity to the target project. Further, the data
analyses presented in Section~\ref{results-anecdotes-1} used allocations to the
target project as the dependent variable. The comparison project was simply the
other focal project to which participants were allocating. It was always a
different type of project to both the target and anecdote projects.

Participants were presented with information about the name, location,
integration (vertical or horizontal), and organisational structure (centralised
or decentralised) of each business (see
Appendix~\ref{allocation-materials-anecdotes-1} for an explanation of these
terms). Further, they were presented with information about the features of each
project that are typically available to managers prior to investment.
Participants in the anecdote only condition were shown only this information
(see Figure~\ref{fig:project-allocation-anecdote-only-materials-anecdotes-1}).
Those in the anecdote \& statistics, anecdote \& enhanced statistics, and
statistics only conditions were shown this information along with measures of
NPV and overall reliability rating (see
Figure~\ref{fig:project-allocation-statistics-materials-anecdotes-1}).
Participants entered their allocation data beneath this table in two text boxes
labelled \emph{Project~A allocation} and \emph{Project~B allocation}, respectively.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Anecdote}

Participants who were presented with an anecdote (those in either the anecdote
only, anecdote \& statistics, or anecdote \& enhanced statistics conditions) were
shown a description of another business project and an accompanying analysis.
Figures~\ref{fig:anecdote-similarity-high-materials-anecdotes-1}
and~\ref{fig:anecdote-similarity-low-materials-anecdotes-1} show the anecdotes
for those in the high and low similarity conditions, respectively. The project
description had a similar layout to that of the focal projects. That is, it
contained information about the business name, location, integration, and
organisational structure of the business. It also detailed several predicted
features of the project. Beneath this description was a paragraph presenting an
analysis of why the project had failed. This paragraph referenced each of the
features in the description to justify the failure of the project.

Participants in the high similarity condition were shown a description of a
project from a business with the same type of investment as the target project
(Project~A). All categorical attributes were identical to those in Project~A,
but all numerical attributes were lower. The analysis explained that the
numerical attributes had failed because they had not reached certain cut-offs.
Critically, these cut-offs were all higher than the matching values in
Project~A. This was done to ensure that the numerical attributes in the anecdote
appeared more relevant than those in Project~A. For instance, in Project~A, oil
extraction was set at 2,200 L/hr, and in the anecdote it was 2,000 L/hr, while
the cut-off was set at 3,000 L/hr. Thus, the failure of the anecdotal project
arising from insufficient oil extraction would appear more relevant because the
oil extraction in both the anecdotal project and Project~A was lower than the
cut-off value. Note, however, that there was uncertainty about the
generalisability of these cut-off values because the participants did not
receive an explicit indication of whether these values were meant to generalise
to other cases.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Follow-up Questions}

Participants who were shown the anecdote were subsequently presented with
follow-up questions. They were asked about how similar they believed the
anecdote was to the target project, how relevant it was to their allocations and
how relevant it would be for their judgements about other projects of that type
(see Appendix~\ref{follow-up-materials-anecdotes-1}).

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants were introduced to the study through the general instructions
followed by the specific instructions for their condition. Participants were
then presented with the allocation task and a description of the focal projects.
All participants except those in the statistics only condition were also
presented with the anecdote description and analysis, and the follow-up
questions.

\subsection{Results}\label{results-anecdotes-1}}

\subsubsection{The Effect of Similarity on Anecdotal Bias}

Anecdotal bias was tested by comparing the statistics only condition with both
the high- and low-similarity anecdote and statistics conditions (see
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-allocation-combined}). The omnibus one-way
ANOVA of these three conditions was significant,
\(F(2, 118) = 4.19\), \(p = .018\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .066\). Planned comparisons show that
participants in the statistics only condition allocated a higher percentage of
their budget to the target project compared with participants in the
high-similarity anecdote with statistics condition,
\(\Delta M = -12.31\), 95\% CI \([-21.53,~-3.09]\), \(t(118) = -2.64\), \(p = .009\); but not
the low-similarity anecdote with statistics condition,
\(\Delta M = -1.48\), 95\% CI \([-10.75,~7.80]\), \(t(118) = -0.31\), \(p = .753\). These findings
provide evidence of anecdotal bias in the high similarity condition only.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-anecdotes-1-allocation-combined-1} \caption{Mean allocation to the target project for the statistics only condition and the two anecdote \& statistics conditions. Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. Raw data are plotted in the background.}\label{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-allocation-combined}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Effect of Enhanced Statistics}

The effect of enhanced statistics was investigated by testing the interaction of
anecdote similarity and evidence type (anecdote \& statistics and anecdote \&
enhanced statistics conditions, excluding the anecdote only and statistics only
conditions). As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-allocation}, the two-way interaction was not
significant,
\(M = 3.89\), 95\% CI \([-8.86,~16.65]\), \(t(238) = 0.60\), \(p = .548\).
Further, the difference between the anecdote \& statistics condition and the
anecdote \& enhanced statistics condition (averaged over similarity conditions)
was also not significant, \(\Delta M = -0.12\), 95\% CI \([-6.50,~6.26]\), \(t(238) = -0.04\), \(p = .971\).
This suggests that providing participants with information about how to think
statistically is not sufficient to facilitate a focus on statistics.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-anecdotes-1-allocation-1} \caption{Mean allocation to the target project, by anecdote similarity and evidence type conditions (excluding the statistics only condition). Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. Raw data are plotted in the background.}\label{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-allocation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Effect of Statistics}

To identify the influence of statistics on participants' allocations, a two-way
ANOVA of the interactions between anecdote similarity (low and high) and
evidence type (anecdote only and anecdote \& statistics conditions, excluding the
anecdote \& enhanced statistics and statistics only conditions) was conducted
(see Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-allocation}). The interaction between
anecdote condition and similarity (excluding the enhanced statistics condition)
was significant, \(M = -13.14\), 95\% CI \([-25.93,~-0.34]\), \(t(238) = -2.02\), \(p = .044\).
Specifically, the difference in allocations between the anecdote only condition
and the anecdote \& statistics condition was greater when the anecdote was
similar, \(\Delta M = -21.56\), 95\% CI \([-32.33,~-10.80]\), \(t(238) = -4.72\), \(p < .001\); compared
with when it was dissimilar,
\(\Delta M = -8.43\), 95\% CI \([-19.32,~2.47]\), \(t(238) = -1.82\), \(p = .164\). These findings provide
evidence of partial anecdotal bias in the high similarity condition because the
anecdote \& statistics condition was lower than the statistics only condition
(shown above) but higher than the anecdote only condition.

\subsubsection{Relevance Ratings}

Regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between
allocations and the follow-up relevance ratings. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-lm-allocation-relevance-specific-alignment},
the specific relevance ratings interacted with similarity condition,
\(b = -2.84\), 95\% CI \([-4.80, -0.87]\), \(t(240) = -2.85\), \(p = .005\). It appears
that specific relevance ratings were related to allocations, but only in the
high similarity condition. Further, there were no significant associations with
the general relevance ratings. This suggests that participants applied reasoning
to the connection between the anecdote and the target project as opposed to
simply reacting to the failed project and associating that with that project's
industry.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1} was supported.
Participants in the anecdote \& statistics condition allocated less capital to
the target project compared with those in the statistics only condition.
However, this effect depended on anecdote similarity because this only occurred
in the high similarity condition, not in the low similarity condition. Thus,
while anecdotal bias was evident when the anecdote was similar to the target
project, participants were not influenced when the causal mechanisms did not
align. Contrary to Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1}, despite being
influenced by the anecdote, participants still made some use of the statistics.
This is different from the findings of \textcite{wainberg2013}, who found no difference
between the anecdote only and anecdote and statistics conditions, indicating a
complete anecdotal bias effect.
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1} was also not supported
because the added enhanced statistical instructions used to encourage
participants to use the statistical information did not reduce participants'
reliance on anecdotes.

Experiment~1 was limited because it only considered a \emph{negative} anecdote; that
is, a failed project. In real life, however, case studies often have a
\emph{positive} valence; that is, the story of a successful company. In fact, in
business, it is possible that the anecdotes used are more likely to be positive
because of survivorship bias. \textcite{jaramillo2019} found an anecdotal bias effect for
negative but not positive anecdotes. This may be because the stimuli consisted
of medical decisions and, in this domain, the loss of health may be more
strongly noted than an equivalent gain in health. In Experiment~2 (discussed in
the subsequent section) a positive anecdote was added to investigate whether
anecdote valence would affect anecdotal bias.

It is unclear whether the effects found in Experiment~1 were related to
participants' perceptions of the type of sampling used to select the anecdotes.
The instructions in Experiment~1 did not explain how the anecdote displayed to
participants was chosen. Whether sampling is believed to be intentional or
random has been shown to affect people's decision-making \autocite[e.g.,][]{hayes2019}. In
the present experiments, participants' sampling assumptions may have changed the
extent to which they used the anecdote in their decisions. For example, it may
be rational to choose the anecdote over the aggregated data if (a) the anecdote
was not sampled randomly from a pool of anecdotes, and (b) the anecdote had a
greater similarity to the target project compared with other anecdotes in the
pool in relevant ways. That is, if the anecdote were chosen because of its high
relevance to the target project, it would be irrational to ignore it. In
Experiment~1, it was unclear whether participants may have held these beliefs.
To control for these assumptions, in Experiment~2, the instructions further
clarified that the anecdote (a) was sampled randomly from a pool of anecdotes,
and (b) was not significantly more similar to the target project than any of the
other anecdotes in the pool.

\hypertarget{anecdotes-2}{%
\section{Experiment~2}\label{anecdotes-2}}

Experiment~1 replicated the anecdotal bias effect found in the literature. That
is, participants allocated less capital to a project when presented with an
anecdote and conflicting statistics compared with when they were presented with
the statistics only. However, this effect depended on anecdote similarity, such
that anecdotal bias was stronger when the anecdote was similar to the current
task compared with when it was dissimilar. A negative anecdote only was used
Experiment~1 because previous research has found anecdotal bias for negative but
not for positive anecdotes \autocite{jaramillo2019}. However, \textcite{jaramillo2019}
investigated medical decision-making, and the effect of anecdote valence may be
different in a business context. In the study by \textcite{jaramillo2019}, the positive
anecdote involved a treatment that led to a reduction in symptoms, while the
negative anecdote involved symptoms persisting. This framing may have led
participants to perceive the positive anecdote as a return to a reference point
and the negative anecdote as a continuation of a reduction in wellbeing relative
to the reference point. In business, however, both successful and failed
business projects represent a deviation from a reference point. To test this
difference further, manipulation of anecdote valence was added to Experiment~2.

To increase the experiment's power, anecdote valence and anecdote similarity
were manipulated within subjects. Further, Experiment~2 did not include the
anecdote \& enhanced statistics condition because Experiment~1 found no
evidence for its effect. All participants saw the statistics only condition,
which did not contain an anecdote; therefore, this did not need to be
manipulated between subjects. Therefore, each participant was shown five
displays: one for the statistics only condition, and four for either the
anecdote only condition or the anecdote \& statistics condition. These four
anecdote displays consisted of the similarity (low and high) \(\times\) valence
(negative and positive) conditions.

In Experiment~1, assumptions about the pool from which the anecdote was sampled
were not clarified. In Experiment~2, participants were told that the anecdote
was sampled randomly and that it was not uniquely similar to the target project.
This was expected to lead to a reliance on statistical evidence, regardless of
the anecdote's similarity. However, people often struggle to use statistical
concepts presented descriptively, as seen in the enhanced statistics condition
in Experiment~1, the neglect of variance shown in Chapter~\ref{alignment}, and
the lack of risk aggregation in descriptive risky decisions shown in
Chapter~\ref{aggregation}. Therefore, it was expected that the results of
Experiment~1 would be replicated for the negative valence condition. Further, it
was expected that there would be a reverse effect in the positive valence
condition. Appendix~\ref{anecdotes-2-appendix} shows a simulation of the
hypothesised effects. Therefore, Experiment~2 tested the following hypothesis:

\begin{hypothesis}[overall effect]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:three-way-anecdotes-2}{}{\label{hyp:three-way-anecdotes-2} \iffalse (overall effect) \fi{} }The three-way similarity \(\times\) valence \(\times\) anecdote (excluding
statistics only) interaction is significant
\end{hypothesis}

The main effect of interest was the effect of anecdote similarity on anecdotal
bias. However, because in Experiment~2 all participants were presented with the
statistics only condition, a difference score was calculated to simplify the
analyses. Specifically, this was the difference between the allocation in the
anecdote \& statistics conditions and the relevant allocation in the statistics
only condition. A score that is different from zero indicates deviation from the
allocation when only statistics were shown. For positive valence, a stronger
influence of anecdote is indicated by a lower difference score; whereas for
negative valence, a stronger influence of anecdote is indicated by a higher
difference score. Therefore, Experiment~2 tested the following hypotheses:

\begin{hypothesis}[anecdotal bias difference score for negative anecdotes]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:anecdote-similarity-negative-anecdotes-2}{}{\label{hyp:anecdote-similarity-negative-anecdotes-2} \iffalse (anecdotal bias difference score for negative anecdotes) \fi{} }For negative anecdotes, the difference between budget allocations to the target
project in the statistics only condition and the anecdote \& statistics condition
will be higher when the anecdote is similar to the target project compared with
when it is dissimilar.
\end{hypothesis}

\begin{hypothesis}[anecdotal bias difference score for positive anecdotes]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:anecdote-similarity-positive-anecdotes-2}{}{\label{hyp:anecdote-similarity-positive-anecdotes-2} \iffalse (anecdotal bias difference score for positive anecdotes) \fi{} }For positive anecdotes, the difference between budget allocations to the target
project in the statistics only condition and the anecdote \& statistics condition
will be lower when the anecdote is similar to the target project compared with
when it is dissimilar.
\end{hypothesis}

Contrary to both \textcite{wainberg2013} and Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1},
Experiment~1 found that participants do integrate statistics in their decisions
to some extent. This effect was expected to be replicated in Experiment~2.
Therefore, Experiment~2 tested the following hypotheses:

\begin{hypothesis}[effect of statistics for negative anecdotes]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:statistics-negative-anecdotes-2}{}{\label{hyp:statistics-negative-anecdotes-2} \iffalse (effect of statistics for negative anecdotes) \fi{} }For negative anecdotes, budget allocations to the target project will be higher
for the high-similarity anecdote \& statistics condition than for the
high-similarity anecdote only condition.
\end{hypothesis}

\begin{hypothesis}[effect of statistics for positive anecdotes]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:statistics-positive-anecdotes-2}{}{\label{hyp:statistics-positive-anecdotes-2} \iffalse (effect of statistics for positive anecdotes) \fi{} }For positive anecdotes, budget allocations to the target project will be higher
for the high-similarity anecdote only condition than for the high-similarity
statistics \& anecdote condition.
\end{hypothesis}

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Ninety-six participants (50 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 41.69 years (\emph{SD} = 11.29, \emph{min.} = 27, \emph{max.} = 74). Participants reported an average of 7.19 years (\emph{SD} = 8.34, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 43) working in a business setting, and an average of 3.91 years (\emph{SD} = 7.67, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 50) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 14.98 min (\emph{SD} = 8.84, \emph{min.} = 2.57, \emph{max.} = 58.71).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-anecdotes-2}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions. Anecdote
similarity and valence were manipulated within subjects. Therefore, each
participant was assigned to one of two between-subjects evidence type conditions
(anecdote only and anecdote \& statistics) and saw five displays (statistics
only, and one of each of the four similarity and valence conditions).
Appendix~\ref{power-analysis-anecdotes-2} describes the power analysis
conducted to arrive at this sample size.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Instructions}

Participants were shown similar instructions to those in Experiment~1 (see
Section~\ref{instructions-materials-anecdotes-1}). The general instructions
page included a test of the basic information expressed in the instructions.
This test also functioned as an attention check. As in Experiment~1,
participants were also shown instructions that were specific to their condition.
These were shown on the same page as the rest of the project display, above the
case study and focal projects. The instructions clarified that the anecdote had
been randomly sampled and that all anecdotes in the pool were equally similar to
the target project. Appendix~\ref{instructions-materials-anecdotes-2-appendix}
shows the instructions used in Experiment~2.

\hypertarget{allocation-anecdotes-2}{%
\paragraph{Allocation Task}\label{allocation-anecdotes-2}}

As in Experiment~1, the allocation task included a table describing the two
focal projects and (apart from the statistics only condition) a description and
analysis of an anecdote.
Figures~\ref{fig:project-allocation-anecdote-valence-negative-similarity-low-materials-anecdotes-2}
and~\ref{fig:project-allocation-target-valence-negative-similarity-low-materials-anecdotes-2}
show the anecdote and focal projects, respectively, for the negative valence,
low similarity condition.

and~\ref{fig:project-allocation-target-valence-positive-similarity-high-materials-anecdotes-2}

high similarity conditions. In the statistics only condition, participants were
only shown the focal projects display.
Appendix~\ref{allocation-anecdotes-2-appendix} details the counterbalancing and

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Interstitial Page}

Prior to the display, participants were shown an interstitial page, which was
used to (a) introduce the display and (b) check the participant's attention
(given that no input was required, participants could easily skip the page
without reading the text). See
Appendix~\ref{interstitial-materials-anecdotes-2}.

\paragraph{Follow-up Questions}

Participants were shown similar follow-up questions as in Experiment~1, except
that in Experiment~2, rating scales were 1--7 instead of 1--6. See
Appendix~\ref{follow-up-materials-anecdotes-2} for a sample display of the
follow-up questions.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants were introduced to the study via the general instructions page.
They were then shown five sets (presented in a random order) containing two
pages each: a page showing the allocation task and a page with follow-up
questions (except for the anecdotes only condition, in which participants were
not shown the follow-up questions page). Each allocation task page contained
specific instructions relevant to the condition followed by the anecdote
analysis and description, and the description of the two focal projects. The only
exception was the statistics only display, for which there was no anecdote
description or analysis.

\subsection{Results}

This section reports only the data relevant to the Experiment~2 hypotheses. See
Appendix~\ref{results-anecdotes-2-appendix} for manipulation check analyses and
analyses of the follow-up rating data.

\subsubsection{Overall Effect of Manipulations}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation}, the similarity
\(\times\) valence \(\times\) evidence type interaction (excluding the statistics
only condition) was not significant,
\(F(1, 94) = 3.42\), \(p = .067\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .035\). However,
the similarity \(\times\) valence interaction was significant,
\(F(1, 94) = 76.41\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .448\), as was the evidence type
\(\times\) valence interaction,
\(F(1, 94) = 10.11\), \(p = .002\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .097\). The analyses below
elaborate on the specific hypothesised effects.



\begin{figure}

In mixed factorial designs, error bars cannot be used to make inferences by ``eye'' across all conditions. Therefore, error bars are not included. Raw data are plotted in the background.}\label{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Anecdotal Bias Depends on Anecdote Similarity}

To investigate whether anecdotal bias depended on anecdote similarity, the
differences in budget allocations between the statistics only condition and the
two anecdote \& statistics conditions (high and low similarity) were calculated.
The values of the statistics only condition were different for each valence
condition to create equivalent comparisons. For the negative valence condition,
participants allocated more money the high-NPV project; while for the positive
valence condition, participants allocated more money to the low-NPV project. As
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference}, the
similarity \(\times\) valence interaction was significant,
\(F(1, 47) = 30.66\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .395\), as was the
main effect of valence, \(F(1, 47) = 9.85\), \(p = .003\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .173\).
The main effect of similarity was not significant,
\(F(1, 47) = 0.53\), \(p = .469\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .011\).

The effect of the anecdote is represented differently for each valence
condition. As such, the interaction was further analysed by comparing the two
similarity conditions for each valence condition. For negative anecdotes, the
statistical values (e.g., NPV) associated with the target project were higher
than those for the comparison project. If participants were influenced by the
negative anecdote they would therefore allocate less to the target. For negative
anecdotes, a lower allocation to the target project is represented in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference} as a positive
value---the difference in allocation from when the participant did not see an
anecdote. For positive anecdotes, the statistics were lower for the target
project, so an influence of the anecdote is seen as a negative value in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference}. The hypothesised
effect of negative anecdote similarity on anecdotal bias would suggest a higher
difference score in high similarity than in low similarity. That is, more
influence of the anecdote when it is similar than when it is dissimilar. For
positive anecdotes a the hypothesised effect would suggest the reverse: a higher
difference score in low similarity than in high similarity.

For negative anecdotes, the allocation difference was greater when the anecdote
was similar to the target project than when it was dissimilar,
\(\Delta M = -18.17\), 95\% CI \([-26.17,~-10.17]\), \(t(93.80) = -4.51\), \(p < .001\). For positive
anecdotes, the allocation difference was greater when the anecdote was
dissimilar to the target project than when it was similar,
\(\Delta M = 14.10\), 95\% CI \([6.10,~22.11]\), \(t(93.80) = 3.50\), \(p = .001\). This provides
evidence that anecdotal bias depends on anecdote similarity for both negative
and positive anecdotes. Participants appeared to be sensitive to the relevance
of the anecdote to the target problem.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference-1} \caption{Mean allocation difference between the statistics only condition and the anecdote \& statistics condition, by similarity and valence conditions. The horizontal dashed line shows the point in which the two allocations were equivalent. Values above this line show the higher allocation to the target project when participants were shown statistics only compared with when they were shown statistics with an anecdote. Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals, calculated from the within-subjects standard errors using the method from \textcite{cousineau2014}. Raw data are plotted in the background.}\label{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Effect of Statistics}

As in Experiment~1, Experiment~2 investigated the extent to which statistical
information influenced participants' allocations. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation}, for negative anecdotes,
participants in the high-similarity anecdote \& statistics condition allocated
more to the target project than those in the high-similarity anecdote only
condition,
\(\Delta M = -12.67\), 95\% CI \([-23.53,~-1.81]\), \(t(336.36) = -2.29\), \(p = .022\).
For positive anecdotes, participants in the high-similarity anecdote only
condition allocated more to the target project than those in the high-similarity
anecdote \& statistics condition,
\(\Delta M = 16.71\), 95\% CI \([5.85,~27.57]\), \(t(336.36) = 3.03\), \(p = .003\).
This provides evidence for the influence of statistics on participants'
allocations for both negative and positive anecdotes.

\subsubsection{Relevance Ratings}

Regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between
allocations and the follow-up relevance ratings.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-lm-allocation-relevance-specific-similarity}
shows these data. While the specific relevance ratings for negative anecdotes
showed the same trends as in Experiment~1, the interaction was not significant.
Similarly, the ratings trends for positive anecdotes were as hypothesised, but
their interaction not significant. It appears that specific relevance ratings
were related to allocations, but only in the high similarity condition. Further,
there were no significant associations with the general relevance ratings. This
provides limited evidence that people were explicitly reasoning about the
connection between the anecdote and target.

Raw data are plotted in the background.}\label{fig:plot-anecdotes-2-lm-allocation-relevance-specific-similarity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

Hypotheses~\ref{hyp:anecdote-similarity-negative-anecdotes-2}
and~\ref{hyp:anecdote-similarity-positive-anecdotes-2} were supported because
participants showed a stronger anecdotal bias effect when both positive and
negative anecdotes had greater similarity to the target project. Further, as per
Hypotheses~\ref{hyp:statistics-negative-anecdotes-2}
and~\ref{hyp:statistics-positive-anecdotes-2}, participants incorporated
statistical information in their judgements, for both negative and positive
anecdotes. Unlike in Experiment~1, the relevance rating data did not provide as
clear indication that participants were using only the specific project
information rather than merely its industry.

Therefore, Experiment~2 found that, unlike in the medical domain, the effect of
anecdotes in financial decision-making does not depend on anecdote valence.
Further, similar to the findings of Experiment~1, and unlike those of
\textcite{wainberg2013}, the anecdotal bias effect does not appear to be complete, with
statistics still playing some role in participants' decisions, despite the
effect of the anecdote.

\section{General Discussion}

Most of the hypotheses were supported. This chapter found that, in the capital
allocation context, people's decisions are influenced by anecdotes, even when
aggregated data are available. There were three novel findings: (a) the
anecdotal bias effect was only seen when participants considered the anecdote
sufficiently relevant to the target project, (b) participants integrated
statistics into their decisions, and (c) these effects were found in both
negative and positive anecdotes. Further, people did not consider verbal sample
distribution information, which could have helped to inform their decisions.
This is surprising since other work showed that generalisations are sensitive to
sampling \autocite{carvalho2021}.

The first novel finding from these experiments is that participants' use of
anecdotal evidence depended on the anecdote's similarity. Specifically, if the
anecdote appeared relevant, participants used it in their decisions. However,
when it appeared irrelevant, participants almost entirely relied on statistics.
The findings for high anecdote similarity are largely congruent with findings
from other work investigating anecdotal bias in business decision-making. As in
\textcite{wainberg2013} and \textcite{wainberg2018}, this chapter found that people allocated less
capital to a project when presented with statistical evidence and a similar but
contradictory anecdote than when they were presented with statistics alone.

It appears that participants distinguished between the low- and high-similarity
anecdotes based on the structure of the anecdote. The low similarity condition
always included the same project type as the high similarity condition for all
domains. For instance, in one variation, both the high- and low-similarity
anecdotes involved oil well projects. However, the high-similarity anecdotes
also matched the target project in a number of specific features. This means
that participants were sensitive to the specific information in the anecdote
description and analysis and did not simply use the project type for their
inferences. Further, participants' answers to the follow-up questions indicated
that they did not consider that the anecdote was necessarily relevant to other
projects from the same industry. In other words, participants did not appear to
carelessly use anecdotal evidence in their decisions; rather, they carefully
considered the anecdote according to its particular causal structure.

The second novel finding from these experiments is that participants who were
shown the anecdote with statistics did not completely disregard the statistical
measures. \textcite{wainberg2013} found a complete anecdotal bias effect because results
for the anecdote only and anecdote \& statistics conditions were equivalent,
meaning that the presented statistics had a negligible effect on participants'
decisions. In contrast, the experiments discussed in this chapter showed a
partial anecdotal bias effect, seen as a difference in allocations between the
anecdote only and anecdote \& statistics conditions. It appears that participants
integrated both anecdotal and statistical information. This suggests that
people's evaluation of evidence may be more sensitive than previously thought.

The discrepancy between these results and those in \textcite{wainberg2013} could be a
result of the sampled population. Since \textcite{freling2020} found that anecdotes had a
stronger effect when decisions were more personally relevant; thus, the managers
recruited for the \textcite{wainberg2013} study may have simply been more personally
invested in the task compared with the laypeople recruited for the experiments
presented in this chapter. Similarly, \textcite{yang2015} found that anxiety increases
anecdotal bias when making risky decisions. However, the discrepancy may also be
attributable to the difference in the anecdote \& statistics condition between
the \textcite{wainberg2013} study and the present work. Specifically, the statistics
presented in the anecdote \& statistics condition in \textcite{wainberg2013} were not the
same as those shown in the same study's statistics only condition, unlike in
both the present experiments and \textcite{wainberg2018}. Instead, it was the anecdote \&
enhanced statistics condition that contained the same statistics as in the
statistics only condition. This suggests that people only integrate statistics
when they are sufficiently clear and no further interpretation is required.

The third novel finding from these experiments is that anecdotal bias was found
for both negative and positive anecdotes. Most previous studies have included
negative anecdotes (i.e.~those with negative consequences) such as a medication
that fails to reduce symptoms. However, there is little work in the literature
involving positive anecdotes (those with positive consequences). \textcite{jaramillo2019}
found an asymmetry in the anecdote effect---the effect of the anecdote was
stronger when the medication failed to improve symptoms (negative anecdote)
compared with when it did improve symptoms (positive anecdote). The present
experiments found a more symmetrical effect---the effects of both anecdotal bias
and statistics were found for both negative and positive anecdotes.

The difference between the findings of this chapter and those of \textcite{jaramillo2019}
may be attributable to the latter's negative anecdote representing a persistence
in a negative shift from the status quo (i.e.~good health). In the business
domain, both positive and negative anecdotes represent shifts from the status
quo (a company's financial position). Nevertheless, it was surprising to find no
asymmetry given the predictions of prospect theory. Loss aversion suggests that
participants will avoid projects that are similar to negative anecdotes more
than they will choose those similar to positive anecdotes. However, each choice
was associated with conflicting statistical information, so this may have
cancelled out the change from the reference point. Future research should use
more realistic incentives to investigate this effect further. Doing so will also
increase the ecological validity of the findings.

\subsection{Theoretical Implications}

The findings presented in this chapter add to the current understanding of the
way in which people use different types of evidence in their decision-making.
Previous research mostly investigated the relative influence of statistics and
anecdotes by comparing anecdotal with statistical conditions. The current work
shows that comparing a joint anecdote \& statistics condition with both an
anecdote only and statistics only condition enables a more specific
investigation of participants' anecdotal bias. The influence of anecdotes can be
seen in the comparison of the statistics only and the anecdote \& statistics
conditions, while the effect of statistics can be seen in the comparison of the
anecdote \& statistics condition and the anecdote only condition. These two
effects enable the determination of the independent influences of anecdote \&
statistics. Use of such a design in future research may help to further the
understanding of conditions under which these types of evidence are used.

Some of the anecdotal bias literature is based on the assumption that using
anecdotal evidence over statistical evidence is necessarily irrational. This is
likely to have arisen from examples in the medical domain in which such
decisions are indeed irrational (e.g., believing that vaccines cause certain
disorders, despite the available evidence). In such cases, people over-rely on
anecdotes and should be relying more on aggregated data. However, a case could
be made for the rational use of an anecdote based on its similarity to the
target problem. For instance, there are times when an anecdote is so similar to
the target situation (e.g., the identical twin example discussed in
Section~\ref{effect-of-similarity}) that it would be unwise not to consider it.
That is, the use of anecdote should depend on both (a) the extent of underlying
structural similarity to the target problem and (b) the distribution of this
similarity across the pool from which the anecdote was sampled. People should
use anecdotes if their casual structures are significantly more relevant
compared with other cases in the available data.

However, similarity can also be misleading. For instance, if a case appears
highly similar but differs in terms of a key hidden dimension that is the real
causal mechanism, then using the anecdote may be the wrong thing to do. What
appears to be important is being sensitive to relational rather than surface
similarity. Future research should investigate how varying participants'
assumptions about sampling from a data set of anecdotes influences their
anecdotal bias. Such assumptions can include the size of the sample, the shape
of the distribution, and where in the distribution the anecdote came from. Prior
work found that people are sensitive to distributional properties when
generalizing \autocite{carvalho2021}, but it is not clear if this will replicate with
descriptive cues such as in the experiments in this chapter.

\subsection{Practical Implications}

The current work contributes to managerial decision-making by providing insights
into how managers make better decisions when using case studies and statistical
information. Managers of large companies are often in a difficult position; they
have incomplete information and are in an uncertain environment. Despite this,
different biases and responses to those biases may be anticipated for different
levels of uncertainty. For instance, a manager may be presented with both a
convincing case study that suggests a certain course of action as well as
aggregated data. The manager needs to be able to weigh the evidence accordingly.

The work in this chapter suggests that there are three elements to consider: (a)
the quality of aggregated data (determined by factors such as sample size), (b)
the relative similarity of the cases in the data pool to the target situation,
and (c) the similarity of the anecdote to the target problem. For instance, an
anecdote that is similar to the target situation in terms of relevance and is
significantly more similar than other cases in the data set should carry more
weight than an anecdote that comes from a pool of cases that are all equally
similar to the target problem. \textcite{lovallo2012} found that similarity judgements
increase prediction accuracy beyond a simple regression model. Taking into
account a project's relative similarity to other cases is likely to further
increase predictive validity.

When aggregated data are not available, however, managers should rely more on
anecdotes that have greater similarities in terms of causal structure. That is,
they should be wary of merely using surface similarities to make inferences and
instead consider the underlying relational structures. The present data suggest
that laypeople can do this to some extent, with participants not being
completely swayed by the mere similarity of type of business project. However,
future research should investigate this further to better understand the
boundaries of people's analogical reasoning in capital allocation decisions.

\minitoc

This thesis investigated the psychology of capital allocation decisions. The
influence of psychological factors on such decisions has not been sufficiently
considered in the literature despite their importance to the performance of
hierarchical organisations. This discrepancy is likely due to a greater focus of
the role of organisational influences on firm performance in the management
literature. The thesis did not investigate expertise effects, but instead
focused largely on participants without management experience. This allowed a
study of the specific cognitive processes without the potential confound of
experience. Though, it is also worth noting that, in the one case where the work
examined people with management experience, the pattern of results was largely
the same as with naive participants. Each of the empirical chapters investigated
distinct but related processes that are relevant to the capital allocation
process. These chapters investigated whether people were able to account for the
benefits of aggregation when considering multiple projects
(Chapter~\ref{aggregation}), the influence of project feature alignability and
metric variance when comparing projects directly (Chapter~\ref{alignment}), and
the influence of project anecdote similarity when the anecdote conflicts with
statistical evidence (Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}).
Section~\ref{summary-of-results} will first summarise the results of the
empirical chapters, and Sections~\ref{theoretical-implications}
and~\ref{practical-implications} will then discuss their theoretical and
practical implications, respectively. Section~\ref{conclusion} will conclude
the thesis.

\hypertarget{summary-of-results}{%
\section{Summary of Results}\label{summary-of-results}}

Chapter~\ref{aggregation} investigated participants' choice of risky business
projects, when these are displayed sequentially and without feedback in between
decisions. This design modelled the real-life situation that managers face in
hierarchical organisations: an evaluation of a set of separate business project
proposals over time with no immediate indication of the performance of those
projects. Aggregating a portfolio of such projects is likely to show a lower
chance of potential loss overall than might be originally assumed. The results
from this chapter showed that people not only did not do this spontaneously, but
also were not facilitated by manipulations that encouraged grouping choices
together as a portfolio. People only seemed to recognise the benefits of
aggregation when they were presented with an outcome probability distribution of
the aggregated set of projects. There was no strong evidence that more subtle
manipulations aimed at encouraging aggregation worked. Specifically, presenting
projects together, specifying the total number of projects, and presenting
projects that were all from the same industry did not reliably encourage
aggregation.

Chapter~\ref{alignment} investigated capital allocation when projects were
evaluated jointly and capital was allocated as a proportion of the budget,
rather than a binary choice. The main manipulation was whether all the project
attributes were alignable, or only the abstract financial metric (NPV) was
alignable. NPV was also manipulated to be considered as either a reliable metric
or not. This information was expressed either as explicit verbal instruction or
as numerical ranges. The results showed that when reliability information was
presented verbally, participants used NPV appropriately when all project
attributes were completely alignable. That is, they used it when it was reliable
and used the intrinsic project features when it was unreliable. When only NPV
was alignable, participants relied on it almost exclusively. However, when
reliability information was presented numerically, participants' allocation did
not depend on the ranges---participants used NPV even when they had an
opportunity to use the intrinsic features of the project. Overall, however,
participants relied on NPV more when projects were low in alignment than when
they were high in alignment.

Chapter~\ref{anecdotes} investigated the effect of anecdote similarity on
allocations when the anecdote conflicted with the statistical data. Participants
were asked to allocate a hypothetical budget between two projects. One of the
projects (the target project) was clearly superior in terms of the provided
statistical measures, but some of the participants also saw a description of a
project with a conflicting outcome (the anecdotal project). This anecdotal
project was always in the same industry as the target project. The anecdote
description, however, either contained substantive connections to the target or
not. Further, the anecdote conflicted with the statistical measures because it
was either successful (positive anecdote) or unsuccessful (negative anecdote).
The results showed that participants' decisions were influenced by anecdotes
only when they believed that they were actually relevant to the target project.
Further, they still incorporated the statistical measures into their decision.
This was found for both positive and negative anecdotes. Further, participants
were given information about the way that the anecdotes were sampled that
suggested that the statistical information should have been used in all cases.
Participants did not use this information in their decisions and still showed an
anecdotal bias effect. Therefore, people seem to appropriately use anecdotes
based on their relevance, but do not understand the implications of certain
statistical concepts.

Together, these results show the bounds of people's decision-making capability
in capital allocation. The participants in these experiments in general behaved
rationally but struggled to incorporate certain statistical concepts into their
decisions. Further, when confronted with multi-attribute choice, participants
tended to allocate capital using a trade-off strategy. This was seen in the
conflict between intrinsic project attributes and NPV in
Chapter~\ref{alignment} and the conflict between the anecdotal and statistical
evidence in Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}. Participants' allocations were informed by
relevant factors when these were sufficiently clear (as in the verbal
reliability condition in Chapter~\ref{alignment}). However, participants
struggled to do this when the factor involved using a relatively basic
statistical concept. Each empirical chapter included such a concept: risk
aggregation in Chapter~\ref{aggregation}, metric variance in
Chapter~\ref{alignment}, and sample distribution in Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}.
The aggregated distribution in Chapter~\ref{aggregation} and the verbal
reliability manipulation in Chapter~\ref{alignment} showed that a formal
understanding of such concepts is not always necessary if they are expressed
explicitly.

The statistical concepts used in these studies are all likely accessible for
people without much formal mathematical knowledge. A basic concept of risk
aggregation is clearly available to laypeople as seen in the responses to
multi-play gambles (e.g., one vs.~100 gambles). Further, people certainly have a
basic understanding of numerical ranges and that a wider range means more
spread. Despite likely having this understanding, participants in the above
experiments were unable to use it in the decisions. Similarly, other work has
shown that generalisations are sensitive to sampling \autocite{carvalho2021}. Therefore,
it is unlikely that the people in the thesis experiments simply lacked any
understanding of these statistical concepts or (at least sensitivity to this
kind of information). Instead there appear to be important contextual factors
that critically support or prevent people from showing their intuitive
understanding. Unfortunately, the methods used in this thesis more closely
resemble real decisions managers make than the prior research that showed people
do reason with these kinds of statistical concepts. Further, it is not clear
that these effects will simply disappear with just more maths knowledge and
business experience. Previous work showed that expertise does not always remove
biases and in some cases it seems to augment such effects \autocite[e.g.,][]{haigh2005}.

\hypertarget{theoretical-implications}{%
\section{Theoretical Implications}\label{theoretical-implications}}

The main theoretical contribution of this thesis is the addition of evidence
that further specifies the conditions under which people make rational decisions
in capital allocation scenarios. People made good decisions most of the time,
but sometimes do not use relevant information in their decisions. Amos Tversky
explained in his response to \textcite[p.~355]{cohen1981} that the work on heuristics and
biases ``portrayed people as fallible, not irrational.'' That is, people are not
constantly making mistakes, but often behave rationally, largely due to adaptive
heuristics. However, sometimes shortcuts that are usually helpful can fail.
Studying such biases is similar to the way that optical illusions help
understand the visual system. In both cases, these are systems that most of the
time function properly, but sometimes reveal deficits.

Similarly, \textcite{simon1955} identified human rationality as \emph{bounded}, meaning that
people's cognitive processes are limited. The main aim of the thesis was to
contribute evidence for the ways that capital allocation decisions are bounded.
To this end, in each experiment, participants were given capital allocation
scenarios alongside both cues that describe their options and cues that frame
the options in different ways. Identifying which cues were used by participants
in their decisions, which cues were ignored, and which cues were integrated
allowed to specify the bounds of people's cognitive capacity in these decisions.
The experiments showed that people struggle to use certain statistical concepts
in their decisions, but that they are also capable of making nuanced trade-offs
and can be assisted by decision aides. Understanding how decision-making in
capital allocation is constrained and biased is important in order to improve
decision-making. Even if decisions are largely consistent with normative
concepts, falling prey to the biases identified in this thesis can have severe
consequences for organisations.

\subsection{Statistical Concepts}

Chapter~\ref{aggregation} presented participants with a capital allocation
situation in which an understanding of risk aggregation would have led to
beneficial outcomes. Investing in all the hypothetical projects would have led
to a much higher chance of gaining money than losing any. Each choice bracketing
manipulation provided a hint of the possibility of combining the choices in this
way. However, participants did not need to compute the aggregated value of the
prospects themselves. An intuitive understanding of aggregation involved
considering that some of the gambles will pay-off and make up for those that
lost. However, this was not seen, with only weak evidence that people were
influenced by the more subtle choice bracketing manipulations. Instead, people
only seemed to respond to the concept of aggregation when it was explicitly
showcased. Showing people a distribution of the outcome probabilities explicitly
visualised the extent to which an aggregation of the risks can lead to an
incredibly low chance of loss.

In Chapter~\ref{alignment}, the NPVs that participants saw were critical to the
allocation task. In the low alignment condition, NPV was the only alignable
attribute in the comparison. In the high alignment condition, however, NPV was
in competition with the intrinsic project feature values. An understanding of
how to use numerical variance would have allowed participants to allocate
capital according to the implied reliability of the comparison metric. In the
low alignment condition, NPV was the only easy way to compare across projects,
so it was a more useful cue than the rest of the non-alignable values. However,
in the high alignment condition, the extent of numerical variance associated
with each NPV could have been used to determine NPV reliability. There were two
ways to do this: (a) noticing that in the low numerical reliability condition
the ranges were all overlapping, and (b) noticing the difference in the width of
the ranges between the two within-subjects reliability level conditions. By
doing this, participants would have then been able to know to (in the high
alignment condition) use NPV when ranges were narrow and use the intrinsic
values more or exclusively when ranges were wider and overlapping. Participants
were able to do this sort of conditional allocation when reliability was
expressed explicitly as words, but not when it was expressed numerically.

In Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}, participants did not make use of descriptive
information about the anecdote sample distribution. As in
Chapter~\ref{alignment}, participants were confronted with a conflict of cues:
statistical information vs.~a potentially relevant anecdote. Regardless of the
similarity manipulation, a consideration of the sample from which the anecdote
was sampled should have informed how the anecdote was used. Imagine a
distribution that represents the similarity of all the individual projects in
the sample. That is, the x-axis represents the similarity to the target project
and the y-axis is the frequency of projects that represent each level of
similarity. Even if the sampled anecdote appears very relevant to the target
project, if the underlying distribution of the sample is highly negatively
skewed, such that most projects in the sample are equivalently similar to the
target, then the sampled anecdote is not necessarily more informative than the
aggregated measure. On the other hand, if the underlying distribution is
positively skewed, normally distributed, or even uniform, then the fact that the
sampled anecdote appears highly relevant to the target project may actually mean
that it is more informative than the aggregated measure. Prior work shows that
people can reason about distributions effectively when experiencing the sampling
directly \autocites[e.g.,][]{hertwig2004,carvalho2021}. Chapter~\ref{anecdotes} shows
that people struggle to use this information when it is described verbally.

While people struggled to understand and use certain statistical concepts they
still seemed to be able to integrate multiple cues and create trade-offs. As
discussed in Chapter~\ref{interstitial-2}, both Chapters~\ref{alignment}
and~\ref{anecdotes} provided participants with more than one cue to use for
project evaluation. In Chapter~\ref{alignment}, people seemed to strike a
trade-off between NPV and the intrinsic project features as opposed to choosing
one or the other with a consistent strategy. In Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}, the
anecdotal and statistical evidence provided conflicting cues for each target
project. However, participants allocated as if both the anecdotes and statistics
had some relevance. Similar to the above, participants appeared to integrate the
influence of these two cues, as opposed to picking a consistent evidence
reliance strategy for their allocation decisions. These findings might be
explained through satisficing \autocite{simon1955} or a constraint satisfaction model
\autocite[e.g.,][]{glockner2014}. Future research can test these explanations, as well as
further clarify to what extent constructs such as need for cognition or
mathematical skill may explain individual differences.

\subsection{Decision Aides}

While trade-offs allow people to integrate multiple cues, decision aides allow
people to use statistical concepts for more nuanced decision-making.
Chapter~\ref{aggregation} found that people's understanding of risk aggregation
was facilitated when the mathematical work was done for them and the aggregated
values were displayed visually as a distribution. However, a follow-up
experiment to Chapter~\ref{alignment} (detailed in Appendix~\ref{alignment-6})
found that even explicit instructions sometimes do not work. That is, even
explaining the way that ranges can be used as reliability information and
telling participants how to implement this in the capital allocation task did
not facilitate proper use of ranges.

Future work should investigate the impact of visualisation on people's use of
variance information in these situations. Much work has investigated visualising
uncertainty information \autocite{bostrom2008,maceachren1992,kinkeldey2017,padilla2018,davis1997,ristovski2014,brodlie2012,johnson2003,potter2012,lipkus1999,lipkus2007,spiegelhalter2011,pang1997,kox2018,lapinski2009,torsneyweir2015}. For instance, a Hypothetical Outcome Plot
\autocite{kale2019,hullman2015} expresses variance information as dynamic plots and is
one method that is likely to be beneficial to people's understanding of ranges
as used in this thesis. Visualisation could also apply to the work in
Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}. Using a visual array as in \textcite{jaramillo2019} is likely to
facilitate people's understanding of the importance of statistical evidence over
anecdotes. However, an additional visualisation of the distribution of the
underlying similarity to the target may also be necessary to facilitate
understanding of the relevance of the sample distribution. Ultimately,
visualisations of the effects of certain statistical concepts may be necessary
for people to use them appropriately.

\subsection{How Bounded is Bounded Rationality?}

The boundary between the cues that participants were able to use and the
statistical concepts that they did not use is unclear. That is, the cues that
they were able to use were not trivial, and the concepts that they were not able
to use are relatively basic. For instance, the finding in
Chapter~\ref{anecdotes} that people were able to use relevance information to
guide their allocations shows an ability to quite specific information to inform
choice. On the other hand, the statistical concepts that participants ignored in
each empirical chapter are all relatively intuitive. While concepts of
aggregation, variance, and sample distribution are typically studied at a
tertiary level, they can be understood when acted out or experienced.

\textcite{clark1993} proposed a distinction between two levels of representing knowledge.
At the \emph{implicit} level an individual can only make use of a certain system of
knowledge, while it is only at the \emph{explicit} level that they develop insight
into that system. For instance, young children can use closed class words such
as ``the'' or ``to,'' but only identify them as words later in development. Further,
children's play often implicitly contains many mathematical concepts, despite
the children's struggle to explicitly reason with the exact same concepts in
more formal problem-solving \autocite{sarama2009}. Adults may have a similar distinction
in knowledge representation. Concepts that can be used when experienced
directly, such as in risky choice from experience, are not represented in a way
that they can be used when presented descriptively, such as in risky choice from
description. This kind of distinction may explain why participants in the thesis
experiments failed to use concepts that have been shown to be accessible to
laypeople.

\subsection{Expertise Effects}

Future research should investigate the potential expertise effects that may
influence the findings of the thesis. This is important because of the potential
downstream effects of biased managerial decision-making. For instance, it is
unclear to what extent psychological factors such as the ones discussed in this
thesis may account for the finding that undiversified firms often perform better
than diversified firms. On the one hand, business professionals tend to work
with numbers, so the effects found in this thesis may be less pronounced for
them. For instance, \textcite{smith1991} reviewed the heuristics and biases literature and
concluded that certain cognitive biases are not as strong for accounting
professionals as they are for naive participants.

On the other hand, these effects may actually be stronger in managers. For
instance, \textcite{haigh2005} found that professional traders show more myopic loss
aversion than students. Chapter~\ref{aggregation} showed that people tend to
consider risky choices one at a time and therefore tend to be more risk averse
to a set of projects than they would be if the risks were aggregated. Managers
might be even more risk averse in these situations because of the increased
stakes for their jobs. \textcite{lovallo2020} discussed the ways in which managers tend to
have a blind spot for such project evaluations: they aggregate their personal
stock market portfolio, but not their intra-firm project portfolio.

Chapter~\ref{alignment} found evidence of variance neglect for both laypeople
and Master of Management students. Further, in the case of the work in
Chapter~\ref{anecdotes}, it is possible that business managers prefer anecdotal
cases to inform their decisions because of their higher salience, compared to
statistical data. Managers are also more likely to feel as if the situation is
relevant to them, which acording to \textcite{freling2020} would predict more anecdotal
bias.

\hypertarget{practical-implications}{%
\section{Practical Implications}\label{practical-implications}}

The findings of this thesis have a number of potential implications for
managerial decision-making. Despite the uncertainty about potential expertise
effects, this section assumes that the findings of the thesis generalise to
experienced managers, if not in degree, at least qualitatively. Management
researchers have suggested ways of overcoming psychological biases in managerial
decision-making ever since such biases were identified. Many
practitioner-oriented papers have used the findings of the judgement and
uncertainty literature both to explain managerial decision-making processes and
to suggest ways of reducing bias \autocite{lovallo2014,koller2012,hall2012,courtney1997,courtney2013,sibony2017}, with only some specifically focused
on capital allocation decisions \autocite{birshan2013}. This section will review some of
the implications the findings of this thesis may have on both organisational
policies and manager decision-making.

The findings of Chapter~\ref{aggregation} show that the framing of business
project proposals is important for the way that people perceive their risk.
Specifically, in order to better account for the risks of business projects it
is important to (a) make it easier for managers to group projects together, and
(b) aggregate a portfolio of projects for them. This suggests implementing
organisational changes that will facilitate the capital allocation process. For
instance, \textcite{lovallo2020} suggested that companies change the frequency that they
evaluate projects to better allow for an aggregation of the projects. Doing this
will enable an explicit computation of the aggregated values and therefore a
visualisation of the outcome probability distribution. Such a process could
facilitate aggregation without a need to rely on managers' intuition during
sequential project evaluation decisions.

One implication of Chapter~\ref{alignment} is that it is important to expose
the variance that underlies abstract financial measures. Further, translating
such numerical variance estimates into clear verbal information would help
facilitate managers' understanding and implementation of such estimates.
Organisational changes could include reducing diversification so that there is
less reliance on abstract metrics. This would allow for more of a comparison
between alignable project attributes, potentially reducing forecast error.
\textcite{koller2017} found that companies with more similar business units report faster
growth and greater profitability than competitors, compared with companies with
dissimilar business units. Further, companies can also work to develop better
metrics and establish norms about how much to discount a metric given its
underlying variance.

The main implication of Chapter~\ref{anecdotes} is that managers should pay
attention to the way that they compare target projects to other cases. It is
important to collect prior cases that are relevant, and to have as many such
cases as possible. Ideally, each such prior case should be weighed by similarity
\autocite{lovallo2012}. If this is done, the prior distribution of the similarity of the
sample would be taken into account when computing subsequent aggregation. When
identifying such similarity ratings, it is important to focus on relevant
underlying structure. This would reduce any erroneous connections to cases that
only have a mere surface similarity. This distinction is also relevant in a
situation in which only one prior case can be found. Research on analogy shows
that analogical comparison helps expose the underlying relational structure
between objects \autocites[e.g.,][]{kurtz2013,markman1993}. Therefore, managers should
take care to first identify such relational structures first before making
subsequent inferences.

Addressing these psychological effects will help eliminate some of the biases in
the capital allocation process, but will not address other related biases. For
instance, the above effects all involve decisions that require an evaluation of
financial forecast estimates such as future cash flows and the related
uncertainty. Therefore, a further source of error could arise from the initial
estimation of these probability and cash flow values. For instance, such
estimates could be influenced by optimism or confidence biases. These biases,
however, can in turn also be addressed \autocite{flyvbjerg2018}.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Capital allocation decisions are consequential for large organisations. This
thesis tested the conditions under which people behave rationally or are
fallible when allocating capital. The experiments found that participants
struggle to incorporate concepts such as risk aggregation, estimate variance,
and sample distribution into their decisions. Participants only seemed to be
able to do this when the concept was expressed visually very explicitly.
However, when there were multiple cues for choice evaluation, the results also
showed that participants were capable of integrating conflicting information in
their decisions. Identifying such cognitive bounds helps to better understand
how people evaluate multiple choices and helps future research develop methods
to facilitate better decisions.

\minitoc

This appendix contains supplementary materials and analyses for the two
experiments reported in Chapter~\ref{aggregation}. In addition, it also report
two experiments that were conducted to follow-up the findings in Experiments~1
and~2. Both follow-up experiments tested project choice as in the first two
experiments, but Experiment~3 further investigated the effect of similarity, and
Experiment~4 further investigated the effect of awareness.

All four experiments featured probability outcome distributions. These were
Poisson binomial distributions that were calculated using the R package
\texttt{poibin}, which uses calculations described in \textcite{hong2013}.

\section{Experiment 1}

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Instructions}

Participants were shown the instructions in
Figure~\ref{fig:instructions-materials-aggregation-1}.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/instructions-materials-aggregation-1-1} \caption{Experiment 1 instructions.}\label{fig:instructions-materials-aggregation-1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Outcome Distribution Decision}

Figure~\ref{fig:project-choice-aggregated-aggregation-1} shows the outcome
distribution display that participants saw in Experiment 1.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{follow-up-materials-aggregation-1-appendix}{%
\paragraph{Follow-up Gambles}\label{follow-up-materials-aggregation-1-appendix}}

\subparagraph{Negative EV Gambles}

It was important to make sure that participants were generally making decisions
that were in line with EV theory and that the sample was not abnormally risk
tolerant. As such, participants saw two project decisions that had a negative
EV. Out of the 396 negative EV gambles
included (two per participant), all but four
were rejected.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textcite{samuelson1963} Gambles}{Samuelson (1963) Gambles}}

Participants saw the original \textcite{samuelson1963} gamble, were asked whether they
would accept 10 of that gamble, and whether they would accept those 10 given the
associated outcome distribution. They then saw the same three questions, but
using outcome magnitudes that were similar to the ones in the risky investment
task. That is, \$100 million instead of \$100.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textcite{redelmeier1992} Gambles}{Redelmeier \& Tversky (1992) Gambles}}

Participants saw the same three types of gambles (single, 10, and aggregated),
but with the values from the gambles that were used by \textcite{redelmeier1992}.

\hypertarget{results-aggregation-1-appendix}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-aggregation-1-appendix}}

\hypertarget{trial-by-trial-aggregation-1}{%
\subsubsection{Trial-by-Trial Analysis}\label{trial-by-trial-aggregation-1}}

Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-1-trials} shows proportions of project
acceptance across all conditions and trials.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-1-trials-1} \caption{Proportion of project acceptance by trial, similarity, awareness, and presentation conditions. LOESS is used for smoothing over trials, and the shading represents 95\% confidence intervals.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-1-trials}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{outcome-distribution-aggregation-1}{%
\subsubsection{Outcome Distribution}\label{outcome-distribution-aggregation-1}}

A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare participants' decision to
invest in the 10 projects while seeing an aggregated distribution, and their
decisions to invest in the projects individually, without the distribution.
Participants invested in the 10 projects more when seeing the distribution both
in the separate presentation phase,
\(t(197) = 5.48\), \(p < .001\), \(d_z = 0.50\), 95\% CI \([0.31, 0.68]\); and in the joint
presentation phase, \(t(197) = 4.17\), \(p < .001\), \(d_z = 0.37\), 95\% CI \([0.19, 0.56]\).

However, it was subsequently discovered that the code that generated this
distribution mistakenly flipped the outcome values. This means that although it
appeared from the distribution that the probability of loss was
0.09, the actual probability of loss of the
underlying values given the correct distribution was
0.26. As such, even though Experiment~1
found an effect of distribution, it was unclear if the effect was driven by
participants actually accurately assessing the riskiness of the individual
gambles, and therefore showing a difference between the isolated and aggregated
gambles in a normative way.

\section{Experiment 2}

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

\hypertarget{power-analysis-aggregation-2}{%
\paragraph{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis-aggregation-2}}

The power analysis was conducted using the \texttt{pwr} package \autocite{champely2020}, based
on the presentation effect size from Experiment~1, since it was the smallest
effect. The analysis suggested that a minimum sample size of
164 (41 \(\cdot\) 4) was required for
the presentation effect with an expected power of at least 80\%.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\hypertarget{follow-up-materials-aggregation-2-appendix}{%
\paragraph{Follow-up}\label{follow-up-materials-aggregation-2-appendix}}

Figure~\ref{fig:project-number-aggregation-2} shows the project number
question. The maximum value that they could enter was set to 20.
Figures~\ref{fig:portfolio-binary-aggregation-2}
and~\ref{fig:portfolio-number-aggregation-2} ask participants whether they are
willing to take all or none of the projects; and how many projects would they
choose if they could pick randomly (maximum value was set to 20). Those in the
distribution absent condition were asked the same questions, but without the
distribution and its explanation.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{results-aggregation-2-appendix}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-aggregation-2-appendix}}

\subsubsection{Follow-up}

\paragraph{Project Number}

Participants were asked how many projects they thought they saw.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-2-project-number} shows that overall people
correctly estimated the number of projects, with more accuracy for those in the
aware condition.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-2-project-number-1} \caption{Number of projects participants reported seeing, by condition.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-2-project-number}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Portfolio Choice - Binary}

Participants were then asked if they would rather invest in all or none of the
projects. As Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-2-portfolio-binary} shows, the
difference between presentation conditions was not significant,
\(\hat{\beta} = 0.15\), 95\% CI \([-0.29, 0.60]\), \(z = 0.67\), \(p = .500\). The
awareness effect was also not significant,
\(\hat{\beta} = 0.28\), 95\% CI \([-0.17, 0.72]\), \(z = 1.21\), \(p = .225\). However,
those that that saw a distribution chose to invest in all 10 projects
significantly more
(71.43\%) than
those that did not see a distribution
(36.59\%),
.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-2-portfolio-binary-1} \caption{Mean choice of investing in all 10 projects for the presentation, awareness, and distribution effects. Note, the condition on the left of each effect is the reference condition (separate presentation, naive awareness, distribution absent). As such, it is identical for the three effects.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-2-portfolio-binary}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Portfolio Choice - Number}

Subsequently, participants were asked how many projects they would invest in out
of the 10 that they saw. As
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-2-portfolio-number} shows, the difference
between presentation conditions was not significant,
\(d_s\) = 0.08, 95\% CI {[}-0.35, 0.52{]}, \(t\)(80) = 0.38, \(p\) = .706. The awareness effect
was also not significant, \(d_s\) = 0.09, 95\% CI {[}-0.34, 0.53{]}, \(t\)(79) = 0.42, \(p\) = .678.
However, those that that saw a distribution chose to invest in significantly
more projects than those that did not see a distribution,
\(d_s\) = 0.60, 95\% CI {[}0.15, 1.03{]}, \(t\)(81) = 2.70, \(p\) = .009.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-2-portfolio-number-1} \caption{Mean number of projects chosen in the follow-up for the presentation, awareness, and distribution effects. Note, the condition on the left of each effect is the reference condition (separate presentation, naive awareness, distribution absent). As such, it is identical for the three effects.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-2-portfolio-number}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gambles}

Figures~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-2-trials}
and~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-2-gamble-values} show that the overall people
seemed to prefer gambles with higher probabilities of gain, sometimes regardless
of expected value or value of the gain.



\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{aggregation-3}{%
\section{Experiment~3}\label{aggregation-3}}

Experiment~3 investigated the effect of similarity on project choice. The
previous experiments did not counterbalance the project domain when displaying
the 10 projects to participants. Experiment~3 used 10 different potential
business domains when constructing the project descriptions in order to reduce
any potential effect that the specific domain may have on people's choice.
Therefore, Experiment~3 again tested
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:similarity-aggregation-1}.

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Two hundred and sixty-six participants (127 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 39.56 years (\emph{SD} = 8.77, \emph{min.} = 25, \emph{max.} = 71). Participants reported an average of 5.64 years (\emph{SD} = 6.45, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 40) working in a business setting, and an average of 3.28 years (\emph{SD} = 4.92, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 30) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 9.23 min (\emph{SD} = 7.2, \emph{min.} = 1.41, \emph{max.} = 65.46).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-aggregation-3}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Instructions}

Participants were shown the same instructions as in Experiment~1 (see
Section~\ref{instructions-materials-aggregation-1}).

\hypertarget{task-aggregation-3}{%
\paragraph{Risky Investment Task}\label{task-aggregation-3}}

Participants saw displays with the same gamble values as those in Experiment~2
(see Section~\ref{task-aggregation-2}), but with some changes in wording and
sentence structure. The gamble information was the same, but extra prose was
added to describe the projects. Further, the order of the sentences was
randomised, so that the descriptions would not appear so similar. See
Figure~\ref{fig:project-choice-aggregation-3} for an example.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/project-choice-aggregation-3-1} \caption{An example of a project display in Experiment~3.}\label{fig:project-choice-aggregation-3}
\end{figure}

The similarity manipulation was as in Experiment~1. However, project domain was
varied so that in the high similarity condition participants saw one of ten
project domains.

\hypertarget{follow-up-aggregation-3}{%
\paragraph{Follow-up}\label{follow-up-aggregation-3}}

The follow-up questions were similar to those in Experiment~2 (see
Section~\ref{follow-up-aggregation-2}), except in the portfolio number question
participants were also shown the total number of projects that they saw (10).
Further, another question was added, asking how many projects participants were
expecting to see at the beginning of the experiment (see
Figure~\ref{fig:project-expectation-aggregation-3}).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/project-expectation-aggregation-3-1} \caption{Experiment~3 project expectation question.}\label{fig:project-expectation-aggregation-3}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants read the instructions and completed the risky investment task in
their respective conditions. After seeing the individual projects, participants
were then asked the four follow-up questions.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Project Investment}

The project investment data were analysed as in Experiment~2 (see
Section~\ref{results-aggregation-2}).
Figures~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-choice}
and~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-proportion} show the choice and proportion
data, respectively. The difference between similarity conditions was not
significant, both in the logistic regression
\(b = 0.00\), 95\% CI \([-0.18, 0.17]\), \(z = -0.04\), \(p = .966\), and in the t-test,
\(d_s\) = -0.21, 95\% CI {[}-0.45, 0.03{]}, \(t\)(264) = -1.69, \(p\) = .093.



\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-3-proportion-1} \caption{Mean proportion of project acceptance for the similarity effect.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-3-proportion}
\end{figure}

Further, Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-choice-trials} shows the choice
data as a function of the order of the project in the sequence. As
Table~\ref{tab:similarity-project-order} shows, there were no main effects or
interactions.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Follow-up}

\paragraph{Project Expectation}

Participants were asked how many projects they expected to see. As
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-project-expectation} shows, the difference
between similarity conditions was not significant,
\(d_s\) = -0.23, 95\% CI {[}-0.47, 0.01{]}, \(t\)(264) = -1.85, \(p\) = .065.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-3-project-expectation-1} \caption{Number of projects participants expected to see, by similarity.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-3-project-expectation}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Project Number}

Participants were asked how many projects they thought they saw.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-project-number} shows that overall people
correctly estimate the number of projects.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-3-project-number-1} \caption{Number of projects participants reported seeing, by similarity.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-3-project-number}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Portfolio Choice - Binary}

Participants were then asked if they would rather invest in all or none of the
projects. As Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-portfolio-binary} shows, those
in the low similarity condition were significantly more likely to want to invest
in all of the projects,
\(b = -0.26\), 95\% CI \([-0.51, -0.02]\), \(z = -2.10\), \(p = .036\).

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Portfolio Choice - Number}

Subsequently, participants were asked how many projects they would invest in out
of the 10 that they saw. As
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-portfolio-number} shows, the difference
between similarity conditions was not significant,
\(d_s\) = -0.14, 95\% CI {[}-0.38, 0.10{]}, \(t\)(264) = -1.12, \(p\) = .264.



\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gambles}

Figures~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-trials}
and~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-3-gamble-values} show the
overall people seemed to prefer gambles with higher probabilities of gain,
sometimes regardless of expected value or value of the gain.

expected value, positive probability, and positive outcome.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-3-gamble-values}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

Experiment~3 found some evidence for the effect of similarity on project choice,
but it was in the opposite direction to the one hypothesised. Specifically, the
results showed that when considering projects individually, participants' risk
aversion did not differ between similarity conditions, but when offered a
portfolio of the projects, those that saw the dissimilar projects were more
likely to invest.

These results provide evidence for the naive diversification account expressed
above (see Section~\ref{similarity-discussion-aggregation-1}). Specifically,
participants may really be naively diversifying, but only when they are
explicitly given an opportunity to do so. This is similar to the multi-play
effects because the question itself provides a sort of choice bracketing. That
is, the gambles are grouped together as a portfolio by the question. Together,
this suggests that people are not naively aggregating when viewing gambles in
isolation, but when the choices are bracketed explicitly, then the choice seems
to be driven by a naive diversification.

\hypertarget{aggregation-4}{%
\section{Experiment 4}\label{aggregation-4}}

Experiment~4 investigated the effect of awareness on project choice.
Experiment~1 found an effect of awareness in the trial-by-trial data that was
not replicated in Experiment~2. Above, this effect was explained through the law
of small numbers: people may have been anticipating less risky gambles towards
the end of the set. As such, the effect could be seen with more trials.
Experiment~4 attempted to replicate the effect from Experiment~1 with 20
projects. The \emph{naive} condition attempted to encourage participants to focus on
projects one at a time and did not reveal the total number of projects. The
\emph{aware} condition attempted to encourage participants to think of all 20
projects. This was done by revealing the total number of projects in the
beginning of the task and by identifying at each project display its order in
the sequence. Experiment~4 again tested
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:awareness-trials-aggregation-2}.

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Two hundred and sixty-six participants (110 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 40.62 years (\emph{SD} = 9.59, \emph{min.} = 25, \emph{max.} = 74). Participants reported an average of 7.45 years (\emph{SD} = 7.8, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 47) working in a business setting, and an average of 5.52 years (\emph{SD} = 7.27, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 48) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 12.66 min (\emph{SD} = 8.26, \emph{min.} = 1.48, \emph{max.} = 53.47).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-aggregation-4}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions.

\begin{table}[tbp]

\end{center}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Instructions}

Participants were shown similar instructions to Experiment~1 (see
Section~\ref{instructions-materials-aggregation-1}), except that the awareness
manipulation was incorporated into the text. Participants in the naive condition
saw the instructions in Figure~\ref{fig:instructions-naive-aggregation-4}, and
those in the aware condition saw the instructions in
Figure~\ref{fig:instructions-aware-aggregation-4}.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/instructions-naive-aggregation-4-1} \caption{Instructions for those in the naive condition of Experiment~4.}\label{fig:instructions-naive-aggregation-4}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/instructions-aware-aggregation-4-1} \caption{Instructions for those in the aware condition of Experiment~4.}\label{fig:instructions-aware-aggregation-4}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Risky Investment Task}

Participants saw similar displays to those in Experiment~3 (see
Section~\ref{task-aggregation-3}). However, here participants viewed 20
projects, so while the gamble constrains explained above were still applied, the
actual gamble values were different. Further, those in the aware condition saw
an added sentence that identified the number of the project they were currently
considering in the context of the total 20. See
Figure~\ref{fig:project-choice-aggregation-4} for an example. Those in the
naive condition saw the same display without this sentence.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/project-choice-aggregation-4-1} \caption{An example of a project display in Experiment~4.}\label{fig:project-choice-aggregation-4}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Follow-up}

The follow-up questions were identical to those in Experiment~3 (see
Section~\ref{follow-up-aggregation-3}), except that the portfolio number
question identified the number of projects they saw as 20.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants read the instructions and completed the risky investment task in
their respective conditions. After seeing the individual projects, participants
were then asked the four follow-up questions.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Project Investment}

The project investment data were analysed as in Experiment~2 (see
Section~\ref{results-aggregation-2}).
Figures~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-4-choice}
and~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-4-proportion} show the choice and proportion
data, respectively. The difference between awareness conditions was not
significant, both in the logistic regression
\(b = -0.05\), 95\% CI \([-0.22, 0.13]\), \(z = -0.53\), \(p = .595\), and in the t-test,
\(d_s\) = -0.09, 95\% CI {[}-0.33, 0.15{]}, \(t\)(264) = -0.73, \(p\) = .464.

\subsubsection{Follow-up}

\paragraph{Project Expectation}

Participants were asked how many projects they expected to see.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-4-project-expectation} shows that those in the
aware condition reportedly expect to see more,
\(d_s\) = -0.94, 95\% CI {[}-1.19, -0.69{]}, \(t\)(264) = -7.67, \(p\) \textless{} .001. However, this is likely to be due to
the fact that they were told how many projects there were.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-4-project-expectation-1} \caption{Number of projects participants expected to see, by awareness.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-4-project-expectation}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Project Number}

Participants were asked how many projects they thought they saw.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-4-project-number} shows that overall people
correctly estimated the number of projects, with higher accuracy for those in the
aware condition.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-aggregation-4-project-number-1} \caption{Number of projects participants reported seeing, by awareness.}\label{fig:plot-aggregation-4-project-number}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Portfolio Choice - Binary}

Participants were then asked if they would rather invest in all or none of the
projects. As Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-4-portfolio-binary}, there was no
significant difference between awareness conditions in wanting to invest
in all of the projects,
\(b = -0.09\), 95\% CI \([-0.33, 0.15]\), \(z = -0.74\), \(p = .460\).

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Portfolio Choice - Number}

Subsequently, we asked participants how many projects they would invest in out
of the 20 that they saw. As
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-4-portfolio-number} shows, the difference
between awareness conditions was not significant,
\(d_s\) = -0.12, 95\% CI {[}-0.36, 0.12{]}, \(t\)(264) = -0.97, \(p\) = .334.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gambles}

Figures~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-4-trials}
and~\ref{fig:plot-aggregation-4-gamble-values} show the
overall people seemed to prefer gambles with higher probabilities of gain,
sometimes regardless of expected value or value of the gain.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

Experiment~4 did not find evidence for
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:awareness-trials-aggregation-2}. There was no significant
effect of awareness on project choice by trial. Participants in the aware
condition were expected to become less risk averse as they continued with the
experiment if they were using a strategy similar to the law of small numbers.
The fact that this effect was not replicated in Experiment~4 might mean that the
finding in Experiment~1 was due to the specific gambles used in that experiment,
or statistical chance.

\chapter{Chapter~\ref{alignment} Appendix}\label{alignment-appendix}}

\minitoc

This appendix contains supplementary materials and analyses for the three
experiments reported in Chapter~\ref{alignment}. In addition, five related
experiments are reported. Experiment~4 was identical to Experiment~1, except
that alignment was manipulated within-subjects, it did not include a no NPV
condition, and there was no forecasting measure. Experiment~5 replicated
Experiment~1, but only tested the forecasting effect and did so with a sample
that had investing experience. Experiment~6 replicated Experiment~5 but with a
larger sample size and a lay sample. Experiment~7 attempted to facilitate a use
of numerical reliability through explicit hints. Experiment~8 tested both verbal
and numerical reliability effects in an all within-subjects design. However,
unlike Experiment~3, the design of Experiment~8 did not allow for a direct
comparison of alignment conditions.

\hypertarget{alignment-2-appendix}{%
\section{Experiment 1}\label{alignment-2-appendix}}

In addition to the allocation measure, participants were also asked to rank the
projects and forecast their future returns. The ranking task was included before
the allocation task in order to encourage alignment and to have another measure
of participants' decision-making. The forecasting task was added (described
further below in Section~\ref{forecasting-materials-alignment-2}) in order to
test whether the variance in people's forecasts is affected by alignment and NPV
reliability.

\begin{hypothesis}
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:ranking-all-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:ranking-all-alignment-2} }All allocation effects will replicate in the ranking measure.
\end{hypothesis}

\begin{hypothesis}
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:forecasting-mean-all-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:forecasting-mean-all-alignment-2} }All allocation effects will replicate in the forecasting mean measure.
\end{hypothesis}

In the forecasting measures, more alignable differences were expected to bring
about more certainty about forecasting decisions, since participants will have
more easily comparable information. As such, people's forecasting should be less
variable when comparing projects with alignable differences, than when comparing
projects with non-alignable differences.

\begin{hypothesis}
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:forecasting-sd-alignment-alignment-2}{}{\label{hyp:forecasting-sd-alignment-alignment-2} }The standard deviation of participants' forecasts will be higher, on average,
in the low alignment condition than in the high alignment condition.

Participants were asked to respond to a forecasting task \autocite[adapted from][]{long2018}, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:forecasting-materials-alignment-2}.

month. This allowed to calculate each participant's forecasting mean and
standard deviation (the latter as inversely proportional to forecasting
precision).

\subsection{Results}\label{results-alignment-2-appendix}}

\subsubsection{Ranking}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and verbally-instructed NPV reliability on participants' rankings of the
target project. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-2-ranking}, the
alignment \(\times\) reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was
significant,
\(F(6.62, 370.54) = 2.70\), \(p = .011\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .046\). This
effect seems to be driven by the differences between the no NPV condition and
the conditions with NPV across the two alignment conditions. Specifically, in
the low alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was significantly lower in the
no NPV condition than both the low reliability condition,
\(M = -6.56\), 95\% CI \([-10.26,~-2.85]\), \(t(112) = -3.50\), \(p = .001\), and the high
reliability condition, \(M = -7.38\), 95\% CI \([-10.83,~-3.93]\), \(t(112) = -4.24\), \(p < .001\).
However, in the high alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was only
significantly lower in the no NPV condition than the high reliability condition,
\(M = -8.37\), 95\% CI \([-11.85,~-4.88]\), \(t(112) = -4.76\), \(p < .001\), and not the low
reliability condition, \(M = -1.71\), 95\% CI \([-5.54,~2.13]\), \(t(112) = -0.88\), \(p = .380\).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-alignment-2-ranking-1} \caption{Mean ranking.}\label{fig:plot-alignment-2-ranking}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Confidence}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and verbally-instructed NPV reliability on participants' confidence rating of
their decisions. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-2-confidence}, the
alignment \(\times\) reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was not
significant,
\(F(7.47, 418.08) = 1.26\), \(p = .267\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .022\).
Contrary to the allocation and ranking data, in
the low alignment condition, there were no significant differences in the linear
NPV trend between the no NPV condition and low reliability condition,
\(M = 10.73\), 95\% CI \([-30.15,~51.61]\), \(t(112) = 0.52\), \(p = .604\), nor the high
reliability condition, \(M = 13.05\), 95\% CI \([-24.97,~51.07]\), \(t(112) = 0.68\), \(p = .498\).
However, as above, in the high alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was
significantly lower in the no NPV condition than the high reliability condition,
\(M = 65.14\), 95\% CI \([26.72,~103.57]\), \(t(112) = 3.36\), \(p = .001\), and not the low
reliability condition, \(M = 31.88\), 95\% CI \([-10.38,~74.14]\), \(t(112) = 1.49\), \(p = .138\).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-alignment-2-confidence-1} \caption{Mean confidence.}\label{fig:plot-alignment-2-confidence}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Forecast Mean}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and verbally-instructed NPV reliability on participants' forecast means. As seen
in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-2-forecast-mean}, the alignment \(\times\)
reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was not significant,
\(F(5.26, 142.10) = 1.89\), \(p = .095\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .066\).
However, the alignment \(\times\) NPV interaction was significant,
\(F(2.63, 142.10) = 2.89\), \(p = .044\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .051\); as well as the
reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction,
\(F(5.26, 142.10) = 7.91\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .227\). The simple
effects appear to be as above. Specifically, in the low alignment condition, the
linear NPV trend was significantly lower in the no NPV condition than both the
low reliability condition,
\(M = 0.19\), 95\% CI \([0.09,~0.30]\), \(t(54) = 3.63\), \(p = .001\), and the high
reliability condition,
\(M = 0.16\), 95\% CI \([0.04,~0.28]\), \(t(54) = 2.75\), \(p = .008\). However, in the
high alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was only significantly lower in
the no NPV condition than the high reliability condition,
\(M = 0.22\), 95\% CI \([0.11,~0.32]\), \(t(54) = 4.04\), \(p < .001\), and not the low
reliability condition,
\(M = 0.08\), 95\% CI \([-0.04,~0.21]\), \(t(54) = 1.30\), \(p = .198\).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-alignment-2-forecast-mean-1} \caption{Mean forecasts.}\label{fig:plot-alignment-2-forecast-mean}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{forecast-sd-alignment-2}{%
\subsubsection{Forecast SD}\label{forecast-sd-alignment-2}}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and verbally-instructed NPV reliability on participants' forecast SDs. As seen
in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-2-forecast-sd}, the alignment \(\times\)
reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was significant,
\(F(6.87, 185.42) = 2.91\), \(p = .007\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .097\).
However, none of the linear NPV trends were significantly different from each
other as above. Of relevance, the low alignment condition on average had higher
SDs than those in the high alignment condition,
\(F(1, 54) = 5.77\), \(p = .020\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .097\).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/plot-alignment-2-forecast-sd-1} \caption{Mean forecast SD.}\label{fig:plot-alignment-2-forecast-sd}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1} was not supported, as
there was no evidence of a main effect of alignment on participants' confidence
in their allocation decisions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the
difference in confidence between reliability conditions is greater in the low
alignment condition. This may reflect participants' difficulty in making sense
of their choices when alignment was low, given more confidence when assured of
the reliability of NPV. In the high alignment condition, on the other hand,
regardless of reliability condition, they had a way of using the reliability
information. Further, confidence also seemed to increase more with NPV, on
average, more when projects were dissimilar, which provides evidence for their
reliance on NPV in this situation. There was limited evidence for the effect of
alignment on forecast variability. Experiments~5 and~6 attempted to replicate
this result with more participants.

\subsection{Results}\label{results-alignment-3-appendix}}

\subsubsection{Ranking}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV,
alignment, and numerical NPV reliability on participants' project rankings.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-3-ranking} shows these data. The alignment
\(\times\) reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was not
significant,
\(F(3.00, 159.10) = 2.44\), \(p = .066\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .044\).
However, the alignment \(\times\) NPV interaction was significant,
\(F(3.31, 370.54) = 21.00\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .158\); as well as the reliability
amount \(\times\) NPV interaction,
\(F(6.62, 370.54) = 9.73\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .148\). As in the
allocation data, the linear NPV trend did not differ between reliability level
condition in neither the low alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = 0.43\), 95\% CI \([-0.77,~1.63]\), \(t(53) = 0.71\), \(p = .480\), nor the high alignment
condition, \(\Delta M = 0.46\), 95\% CI \([-0.92,~1.84]\), \(t(53) = 0.67\), \(p = .504\). However,
averaging over reliability level, the linear NPV trend was higher in the low
alignment condition than in the high alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = -4.54\), 95\% CI \([-6.39,~-2.68]\), \(t(53) = -4.91\), \(p < .001\).

\subsubsection{Confidence}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV,
alignment, and numerical NPV reliability on participants' confidence ratings.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-3-confidence} shows these data. Only the main
effect of NPV was significant,
\(F(2.62, 139.08) = 2.97\), \(p = .041\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .053\).

\subsubsection{Variance Lecture}

The allocation and ranking data show that participants were affected by the
similarity of options, but were not affected by variance information. After the
main task of this experiment, participants were shown a short lecture about the
importance of variance information when making allocation decisions. They were
then presented with half of their previous allocations and gave them an
opportunity to amend their allocations. It was hypothesised that participants
will be more sensitive to variance after the educational intervention.

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of phase on
participants' project allocations. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-3-variance-lecture}, the four-way interaction
was not significant,
\(F(2.56, 133.09) = 1.74\), \(p = .169\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .032\).
Further, the NPV \(\times\) phase \(\times\) reliability level interactions were not
significant for either the low alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = 4.43\), 95\% CI \([-23.71,~32.58]\), \(t(52) = 0.32\), \(p = .753\); or the
high alignment conditions,
\(\Delta M = -11.92\), 95\% CI \([-43.39,~19.55]\), \(t(52) = -0.76\), \(p = .451\). In the
low alignment condition, the linear NPV trend (averaged over reliability level)
was significantly weaker after the lecture, compared with the linear NPV trend
before the lecture, \(\Delta M = -12.85\), 95\% CI \([-24.08,~-1.62]\), \(t(52) = -2.30\), \(p = .026\).
However, this comparison was not significant in the high alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = -6.37\), 95\% CI \([-18.93,~6.18]\), \(t(52) = -1.02\), \(p = .313\). These results
suggest that participants did not become better informed by NPV numerical
reliability after the variance lecture. There was, however, some reduction in
reliance on NPV overall when projects were dissimilar.

\subsubsection{NPV Knowledge}

A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of experiment
phase condition on participants' NPV knowledge rating.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-3-npv-knowledge} shows these data. The main
effect of phase was significant, \(F(2.43, 128.59) = 7.80\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .128\).
The post-explanation rating was significantly higher than the pre-explanation
rating,
\(\Delta M = -0.59\), 95\% CI \([-0.92,~-0.26]\), \(t(53) = -5.07\), \(p < .001\). However, there were no significant
differences in rating between any of the later phases.

\paragraph{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis-alignment-8}}

A power analysis was conducted through simulation of the effects hypothesised in
Experiment~3 (and the simple effects implied by them). The simulated data used
the same regression coefficients as Experiment~2 for the explicit condition, no
effects for the implicit condition (as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-simulation-alignment-8}), and the intercept and residual
variance of Experiment~2. The null effects were analysed using the two one-sided
tests (TOST) procedure, or \emph{equivalence} testing \autocite{lakens2018}, and setting the
smallest effect size of interest to the smallest difference that leads to a
significant equivalence between low and high implicit reliability for low
alignment in Experiment~8 (see Appendix~\ref{alignment-7}).
Figure~\ref{fig:power-curve-alignment-8} shows the resulting power curve. The
analysis suggests a total sample size of 448
(112 \(\cdot\) 4).

\subsection{Results}

\hypertarget{results-alignment-8-allocation}{%
\subsubsection{Allocation}\label{results-alignment-8-allocation}}

The three-way interaction (reliability level \(\times\) NPV \(\times\) reliability
type) in the high alignment condition was significant,
\(\Delta M = 35.43\), 95\% CI \([20.74,~50.12]\), \(t(444) = 4.74\), \(p < .001\). The NPV \(\times\)
reliability type (averaging over reliability level) in the low alignment
condition was significant,
\(\Delta M = 11.48\), 95\% CI \([0.19,~22.77]\), \(t(444) = 2.00\), \(p = .046\). The association
between allocation and NPV for those in the explicit low reliability
condition was significantly stronger for those in the low alignment condition,
than for those in the high alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = 35.68\), 95\% CI \([22.27,~49.09]\), \(t(444) = 5.23\), \(p < .001\).
The linear NPV trend for those in the low alignment condition was
significantly stronger for those in the explicit reliability condition, than for
those in the implicit reliability condition (averaging over reliability level),
\(\Delta M = 11.48\), 95\% CI \([0.19,~22.77]\), \(t(444) = 2.00\), \(p = .046\). The linear
NPV trend for those in the implicit reliability condition was not
significantly ``equivalent'' between those in the low and high reliability
conditions for both those in the low alignment
\(\Delta M = 1.64\), 95\% CI \([-8.74,~12.03]\), \(t(444) = 0.31\), \(p = .620\)
and high alignment conditions
\(\Delta M = -1.21\), 95\% CI \([-11.59,~9.18]\), \(t(444) = 0.22\), \(p = .589\).
However, this is likely to be because the ``lowest effect size of interest''
estimate originated from an analysis used before data collection that was
different to the one that one used after data collection. Specifically, a
univariate linear model was originally used (treating NPV as a continuous
predictor), whereas the data were ultimately analysed using a multivariate
linear model (treating NPV as a repeated measures factor). In the numerical
reliability condition, a pilot experiment (see Appendix~\ref{alignment-7})
suggested that the linear NPV trend would be equivalent between those in the low
and high alignment conditions, averaged over reliability level. However, the
test of equivalence was not significant,
\(\Delta M = 15.19\), 95\% CI \([3.90,~26.48]\), \(t(444) = 2.64\), \(p = .996\).

\hypertarget{alignment-1}{%
\section{Experiment~4}\label{alignment-1}}

Experiment~4 further investigated the effects of alignment and verbal NPV
reliability information on capital allocation decisions. Experiment~4 used the
same methodology as in Experiment~1 (see Section~\ref{method-alignment-2}),
except for two main changes. First, the alignment conditions were manipulated
within subjects. Second, the no NPV condition in the NPV reliability variable
was removed.

The results of Experiment~1 were expected to replicate (see
Section~\ref{results-alignment-2}). Specifically, it was expected that in the
high alignment condition, participants will be able to respond to each
reliability condition, whereas, in the low alignment condition, they will rely
more on NPV regardless of reliability condition.

In addition to the all-project allocation data analysed above, analyses for just
the ``target project'' are also reported. This refers to allocation of capital to
the project that had the highest NPV, but the lowest value on concrete measures
intrinsic to the actual product (e.g., the capacity of a laptop in gigabytes).
Therefore, a higher allocation value indicated a higher reliance on NPV.
Further, the method and analyses for the confidence measure are also reported.

\begin{hypothesis}
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1}{}{\label{hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1} }Participants will be more confident about their decisions in the high alignment
condition than in the low alignment condition.
\end{hypothesis}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Seventy-one participants (44 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 33.27 years (\emph{SD} = 10.21, \emph{min.} = 18, \emph{max.} = 65).~Table~\ref{tab:condition-allocation-alignment-1}
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions. The two alignment conditions
(low and high) were presented within subjects and the order of their
presentation was randomised. Further, NPV was varied within subjects.

The project display, allocation task, and confidence task were the same as in
Experiment~1 (see Section~\ref{materials-alignment-2}).

\paragraph{Instructions}

Participants were shown similar instructions to Experiment~1 (see
Section~\ref{instructions-materials-alignment-2}), except for the addition of
references to the multiple displays and the removal of an explanation about the
forecasting task.
Figures~\ref{fig:instructions-reliability-low-materials-alignment-1}
and~\ref{fig:instructions-reliability-high-alignment-1} show the instructions
for each NPV reliability condition.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The procedure was the same as in Experiment~1, except that there were no
forecasting or ranking tasks.

\hypertarget{results-alignment-1}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-alignment-1}}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment,
verbal NPV reliability, and NPV on participants' project allocations. As
seen in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-1-allocation}, the alignment \(\times\)
reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was not significant,
\(F(3.64, 250.93) = 1.71\), \(p = .153\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .024\). This
is most likely due to the fact that the reliability level \(\times\) NPV
interaction was significant in the high alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = -64.82\), 95\% CI \([-102.70,~-26.93]\), \(t(69) = -3.41\), \(p = .001\), the low alignment
condition, \(\Delta M = -37.74\), 95\% CI \([-70.92,~-4.56]\), \(t(69) = -2.27\), \(p = .026\), as well as
averaging over alignment conditions,
\(F(2.98, 205.65) = 4.90\), \(p = .003\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .066\). Despite this,
the alignment \(\times\) NPV interaction was significant,
\(F(3.64, 250.93) = 3.19\), \(p = .017\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .044\), such that the linear
trend of NPV was stronger in the low alignment,
\(\Delta M = 13.28\), 95\% CI \([-3.31,~29.87]\), \(t(69) = 1.60\), \(p = .115\) than in the high alignment
condition, \(\Delta M = -10.67\), 95\% CI \([-29.62,~8.27]\), \(t(69) = -1.12\), \(p = .265\). However, neither of
these trends were individually significant.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Confidence}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment,
verbal NPV reliability, and NPV on participants' confidence in their
allocations. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-1-confidence}, the
difference between alignment conditions was not significant,
\(F(1, 69) = 2.76\), \(p = .101\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .038\). However, the reliability \(\times\)
alignment interaction was significant, as well as the NPV \(\times\)
alignment interaction. An exploratory analysis was conducted of the relevant
simple effects for each interaction, applying a Šidák correction to the p values
for each effect. None of the simple effects were significant after the
correction.

The raw mean differences indicated that there was a greater difference between
reliability conditions in the low alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = -8.83\), 95\% CI \([-17.84,~0.18]\), \(t(69) = -1.95\), \(p = .055\) compared to the high alignment
condition, \(\Delta M = 2.37\), 95\% CI \([-8.65,~13.40]\), \(t(69) = 0.43\), \(p = .669\). Further, there was
a stronger linear trend of NPV in the low alignment condition,
\(\Delta M = 18.70\), 95\% CI \([-0.87,~38.26]\), \(t(69) = 2.44\), \(p = .067\) compared to the high alignment
condition, \(\Delta M = -6.40\), 95\% CI \([-26.84,~14.04]\), \(t(69) = -0.80\), \(p = .891\).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

Experiment~4 found evidence for most of the hypotheses. As per
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2}, laypeople responded
appropriately to verbal reliability instructions in the high alignment
condition. Contrary to
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2}, however,
participants also did this in the low reliability condition. That is, regardless
of the type of project display, participants tended to use NPV more when they
were told that it was reliable and tended to use it less when they were told
that it was unreliable. Further, there was no evidence that this effect was
depended on alignment condition, contrary to
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2}. However,
the linear NPV trend was higher in the high than low alignment condition,
when averaging over reliability level, as predicted in
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2}. This suggests that
overall participants still make more use of NPV information when it is hard to
compare between projects.

Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1} was not supported, as
there was no evidence of a main effect of alignment on participants' confidence
in their allocation decisions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the
difference in confidence between reliability conditions was greater in the low
alignment condition. This may reflect participants' difficulty in making sense
of their choices when alignment was low, given more confidence when assured of
the reliability of NPV. In the high alignment condition, on the other hand,
regardless of reliability condition, they had a way of using the reliability
information. Further, confidence also seemed to increase more with NPV, on
average, more when projects were dissimilar, which provides evidence for their
reliance on NPV in this situation.

\hypertarget{alignment-4}{%
\section{Experiment~5}\label{alignment-4}}

Experiment~5 further investigated the effects of alignment and explicit NPV
Presence information on forecasting. The goal of this experiment was to
replicate the forecasting results of Experiment~1, but with a sample that has
investing experience. As before, the hypothesis was that people's forecasting
would be less variable when comparing projects with alignable differences, than
when comparing projects with non-alignable differences.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The procedure was the same as in Experiment~1, except participants only
completed the forecasting task.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Forecast Mean}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and NPV presence on participants' forecasts. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-4-forecast-mean}, the alignment \(\times\)
reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was not significant,
\(F(2.75, 154.16) = 0.72\), \(p = .531\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .013\).
Despite this, as in the previous experiments, the interaction between the linear
NPV trend and NPV presence was significant in the high alignment condition,
\(M = -0.12\), 95\% CI \([-0.21,~-0.02]\), \(t(56) = -2.50\), \(p = .015\), but not in the
low alignment condition,
\(M = -0.05\), 95\% CI \([-0.16,~0.07]\), \(t(56) = -0.81\), \(p = .424\).

\hypertarget{forecast-sd-alignment-4}{%
\subsubsection{Forecast SD}\label{forecast-sd-alignment-4}}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment

differences between alignment conditions,
\(F(1, 56) = 0.41\), \(p = .522\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .007\). The alignment \(\times\)
reliability level \(\times\) NPV interaction was not significant,
\(F(2.99, 167.18) = 1.27\), \(p = .287\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .022\).
However, as above, the interaction between the linear NPV trend and NPV presence
was significant in the high alignment condition,
\(M = 0.02\), 95\% CI \([0.00,~0.04]\), \(t(56) = 2.06\), \(p = .045\), but not in the
low alignment condition, \(M = 0.01\), 95\% CI \([-0.02,~0.03]\), \(t(56) = 0.38\), \(p = .709\).

\subsection{Discussion}

Experiment~5 found that people with some investing experience responded to
alignable information in the form of NPV when it is given, but did not show the
same effect of alignment on forecast SD that was seen in Experiment~1.

\section{Experiment~6}

Experiment~6 further investigated the effects of alignment and NPV Presence
information on forecasting. Experiment~5 did not clearly replicate the
forecasting results of Experiment~1, potentially due to low power, so this
experiment collected a much larger sample size. As before, it was hypothesised
that people's forecasting would be less variable when comparing projects with
alignable differences, than when comparing projects with non-alignable
differences.

Three hundred and eighty-nine participants (170 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific.

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment

\(F(3.08, 1,186.45) = 3.13\), \(p = .024\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .008\).
As in the previous experiments, the interaction between the linear

Experiment~6 did not replicate the effect of alignment on forecast SD seen in
Experiment~1. However, participants still seemed to pay attention to the task,
as seen in their higher forecasts for the high NPV project when NPV was present.

\hypertarget{alignment-6}{%
\section{Experiment~7}\label{alignment-6}}

Experiment~7 investigated potential ways to facilitate people's use of variance
in capital allocation. Arguably, people's decisions should depend on variance,
especially with a small set of projects. That is, when considering between two
potential measures to use for capital allocation, measures with narrow ranges
should be relied upon more than those with wider ranges. As such, this
experiment presented participants with the same capital allocation scenario as
in Experiment~2, but only in low numerical reliability displays. Experiment~7
varied both the variance associated with NPV, and the extent to which
participants were explicitly hinted to use the variance information. It was
predicted that participants' allocations would be more likely to be informed by
variance when told explicitly to do so with increased salience for variance,
than when only salience is increase, or when no hint is given.

\subsubsection{Instructions}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:instructions-no-hint-alignment-6}, participants in
the no hint condition saw the same instructions as in Experiment~1. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:instructions-salience-only-alignment-6}, those in the salience
only condition saw the instructions along with a sentence that drew attention to
the \emph{Cash inflow range} row. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:instructions-salience-hint-alignment-6}, those in the
salience + hint condition saw the instructions along with a specific description
of how to use the variance information in their allocation decisions.

\subsubsection{Project Display}

The project displays were the same as Experiment~2 (see

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants read the instruction page as per their hint condition, and then
proceeded to complete one set of ranking and allocations.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Allocation}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of hint
and NPV variance on participants' allocations. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-6-allocation}, none of the interactions or main
effects were significant.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Ranking}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of hint and NPV
variance on participants' project rankings. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-6-ranking}, only the main effect of NPV
was significant, \(F(2.03, 148.33) = 7.59\), \(p = .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .094\).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

Experiment~7 found that explicitly telling participants how to use variance
information to inform their allocations did not help them do so. However,
there was an increased reliance on NPV with more hints in the ranking data. This
suggests that the hint manipulations potentially simply increase participants'
attention to NPV. It is possible that the study was under-powered, as there was
substantial variance in both the allocation and ranking data. Future work should
attempt to replicate this experiment with a larger sample.

\hypertarget{alignment-7}{%
\section{Experiment~8}\label{alignment-7}}

Experiment~8 tested the alignment and reliability effects found in the previous
experiments, while addressing their limitations. Experiments~1 and~4 found a
verbal reliability effect. That is, laypeople allocated more capital to a high
NPV project, depending on how reliable they were told NPV was as a measure.
Experiment~2 found a lack of a numerical reliability effect. That is, business
students allocated an equivalent amount of capital to projects associated with a
high variance NPV, as projects with a low NPV. Testing these two effects in two
different populations did not account for potential expertise effects. As such,
Experiment~8 tested both effects with a naive sample. Further, Experiment~8 used
projects whose features more clearly indicate their profitability, and included
more project domains.

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Fifty-two participants (33 female) were recruited from both the online recruitment platform Prolific and a cohort of psychology undergraduates at The University of Sydney. Participants from Prolific were compensated at a rate of \pounds 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK), and participants from the undergraduate sample were compensated with course credit. The average age was 24.46 years (\emph{SD} = 7.77, \emph{min.} = 18, \emph{max.} = 68). Participants reported an average of 2.63 years (\emph{SD} = 4.16, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 25) working in a business setting, and an average of 0.81 years (\emph{SD} = 1.39, \emph{min.} = 0, \emph{max.} = 5) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 35.57 min (\emph{SD} = 71.96, \emph{min.} = 7.36, \emph{max.} = 511.74).~All conditions were presented within-subjects:
alignment (low and high), NPV reliability type (numerical and verbal), NPV (low
and high), and NPV reliability level (low and high).

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Instructions}

Participants saw instructions similar to the previous experiments.

\paragraph{Project Display}

Participants saw and responded to four webpage displays. At the top of each
display was a text preamble, and underneath this a table that contained project
descriptions. The two columns to the right of each description contained text
boxes for participants to enter a value for the project ranking and budget
allocation. Alignment was manipulated by asking participants to either compare
between each of the project pairs (high alignment), or across all eight projects
in the display (low alignment). For instance, in the high alignment display,
participants had to compare between two railway projects, and then separately
between two logistics projects, etc. However, in the low alignment display,
participants had to compare railway projects to logistics projects directly.
This was manipulated within-subjects, such that project descriptions were
identical across alignment conditions and only the type of comparison (and the
associated preamble text) varied.

Figures~\ref{fig:alignment-low-reliability-explicit},~\ref{fig:alignment-low-reliability-implicit},~\ref{fig:alignment-high-reliability-explicit},~\ref{fig:alignment-high-reliability-implicit}
show the four conditions that participants saw (counterbalanced). Each
description provided the name of the business involved in the project, the type
of project, three specific features of the project, an NPV, and an indication of
reliability (either numerical through ranges or verbal through explicit labels).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/alignment-low-reliability-explicit-1} \caption{Experiment 8 low alignment, verbal reliability display. Cropped for space (full display had eight projects).}\label{fig:alignment-low-reliability-explicit}

\end{figure}

\end{figure}

The value of each type of reliability was also manipulated. Explicit reliability
was manipulated by varying whether participants were told that a project pair
was in an industry in which NPV is considered a reliable or unreliable measure.
Implicit reliability was manipulated by presenting NPVs alongside numerical
ranges instead of verbal reliability information about them, and varying whether
the range was high or low. Both of these were manipulated within-display, such
that NPV was reliable for four projects in each display, and NPV was unreliable
for the other four.

Each project had an associated NPV, which was crossed with each project pair's
intrinsic features. That is, each pair had one project with a high NPV and low
intrinsic feature values, and one project with a low NPV and high intrinsic
feature values. As such, a reliance on NPV was inferred if participants
allocated the high NPV project more capital, or a reliance on the intrinsic
features if participants allocated the low NPV project more capital.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants viewed the instructions and then completed the ranking and
allocation tasks in the four sets of project descriptions. The order of the
display was counterbalanced, and the order of the project pairs on each page was
randomised.

\subsection{Results}

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and NPV reliability type on participants project allocations. A direct
comparison of the two alignment conditions was not possible due to the different
allocation input scales, so the NPV reliability level \(\times\) NPV
interaction was tested separately in each alignment condition (see
Figures~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-7-allocation-alignment-low}
and~\ref{fig:plot-alignment-7-allocation-alignment-high}). This interaction was
significant for both the high alignment condition,
\(F(1, 51) = 27.81\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .353\);
and the low alignment condition,
\(F(1, 51) = 7.63\), \(p = .008\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .130\).
However, there was a significant effect of NPV in the low verbal reliability
condition in high alignment,
\(\Delta M = 18.69\), 95\% CI \([2.87,~34.52]\), \(t(113.10) = 3.17\), \(p = .012\); but not in
low alignment,
\(\Delta M = 6.04\), 95\% CI \([-9.24,~21.32]\), \(t(121.35) = 1.06\), \(p > .999\).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

Experiment~8 found that when variance was presented verbally, participants
allocated according to the reliability information, for both low and high
alignment conditions. When variance was presented numerically, there were no
differences in allocations, for both low and high alignment conditions. Further,
there was an effect of NPV in low reliability for the high alignment condition,
but not the low alignment condition. This effect shows that people still relied
on NPV more than they should when comparing across dissimilar projects.

This experiment shows that similar to the previous experiments, when controlling
for presentation and domain, people still find it easier to allocate capital
based on explicit reliability information when projects are comparable. However,
due to the difference in scale across alignment conditions, a direct alignment
effect was more difficult to test than with the previous experiments. Further,
similar to Experiment~2, Experiment~8 showed that people without much business
experience also struggle to use range information in capital allocation to such
an extreme extent that they do not seem to be using any coherent allocation
strategy.

\section{Experiment 1}\label{anecdotes-1-appendix}}

Below are hypotheses that were tested, but were not sufficiently relevant for
Chapter~\ref{anecdotes} to be reported in the main text.

\begin{hypothesis}[Allocation similarity manipulation check for negative anecdote]
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:similarity-check-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:similarity-check-anecdotes-1} \iffalse (Allocation similarity manipulation check for negative anecdote) \fi{} }For negative anecdotes, allocations for the anecdote only low similarity

\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-similarity-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-similarity-anecdotes-1} \iffalse (Relationship between allocation and perceived similarity for negative anecdote) \fi{} }In the negative valence condition, the correlation between allocation and

\protect\hypertarget{hyp:allocation-specific-relevance-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:allocation-specific-relevance-anecdotes-1} \iffalse (Relationship between allocation and specific-relevance for negative anecdote) \fi{} }In the negative valence condition, there will be no correlation between
allocation and specific-relevance rating in the low similarity condition, but a
negative correlation in the high similarity condition.
\end{hypothesis}

After the allocation task, participants were asked to rate the relevance of the
anecdote to the target project. It was predicted that those that saw only an
anecdote would be more influenced by the similarity of the anecdote than those
that saw an anecdote as well as statistics. Therefore, the following hypotheses
were tested:

\begin{hypothesis}
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:relevance-specific-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:relevance-specific-anecdotes-1} }The similarity effect on specific relevance will be greater in the anecdote only
condition than in the anecdote + statistics condition.

\protect\hypertarget{hyp:relevance-specific-enhanced-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:relevance-specific-enhanced-anecdotes-1} }The similarity effect on specific relevance will be greater in the statistics +
anecdote condition than in the anecdote + enhanced statistics condition.
\end{hypothesis}

Further, participants were asked to rate the relevance of the anecdote to other
projects in the same industry. It was predicted that those that saw only an anecdote
would be more influenced by the similarity of the anecdote than those that saw
an anecdote as well as statistics. Therefore, the following hypotheses are
tested:

\begin{hypothesis}
\protect\hypertarget{hyp:relevance-general-anecdotes-1}{}{\label{hyp:relevance-general-anecdotes-1} }The similarity effect on general relevance will be greater in the anecdote only

\hypertarget{power-analysis-anecdotes-1}{%
\paragraph{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis-anecdotes-1}}

The sample size for Experiment~1 was determined by conducting power analyses
using the \texttt{Superpower} package \autocite{lakens2019}. The package uses experimental
design, and predicted means and standard deviation, to conduct a priori power
calculations. Data from \textcite{wainberg2018}, \textcite{jaramillo2019}, and \textcite[Study~3]{hoeken2009}
was used to determine realistic means and standard deviations for the evidence
and similarity factors. According to the power functions, the resulting sample
size is assumed to allow for an expected power of at least 80\%.

Data from \textcite{wainberg2018} were used to determine the predicted means for the
anecdote conditions. Specifically, the values for the high similarity condition
were taken from the anecdote \& statistics, anecdote \& enhanced statistics, and
statistics only conditions for the corresponding anecdote conditions. This was
done because in \textcite{wainberg2018} the anecdote was always of a similar case.
\textcite{wainberg2018} did not use an anecdote only condition, but \textcite{wainberg2013} did and
found no significant differences between the anecdote only condition and the
anecdote \& statistics condition. As such, the same mean value was used for both
conditions.

It was hypothesised that there will only be an effect of similarity for the
anecdote only and anecdote \& statistics conditions. As such, the data from
\textcite[Study~3]{hoeken2009} were used to determine the corresponding mean values for
the low similarity condition. Specifically, each predicted mean was multiplied
by the Cohen's \(d_z\) of the similarity effect in \textcite[Study~3]{hoeken2009}.

To determine the predicted standard deviation, the data from \textcite{jaramillo2019} \protect\hyperlink{anecdotes-2-appendix}{Experiment~2} and \textcite[Study~3]{hoeken2009} were re-analysed to determine the
coefficient of variation (CV) of each condition. Each CV was then converted to a
standard deviation value in the relevant scale by multiplying the mean of the CV
values by the predicted means from above.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:power-analysis-anecdotes-1}, the power analysis
suggested that a minimum sample size of 294
(42 \(\cdot\) 7) is required for the interaction effect with
an expected power of at least 80\%.

A horizontally integrated company is one which is made up of multiple businesses

is made up of multiple business than operate in the same market, but in
different levels of the supply chain \autocite{gaughan2012a}. A centralised
organisational structure is one in which a company decisions tend to come from a
specific business unit or leader, whereas a decentralised structure is one in
which decisions can be made by separate units or people independently

\subsection{Results}\label{results-anecdotes-1-appendix}}

\subsubsection{Allocation}

A two-way ANOVA was conducted to investigate the interaction of similarity (low
and high) and anecdote conditions (anecdote only, statistics \& anecdote,
anecdote \& enhanced statistics). The main text reports the more relevant
interaction that excludes the enhanced statistics condition. There was a main
effect of anecdote type, \(F(2, 238) = 14.47\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .108\); and a main
effect of similarity, \(F(1, 238) = 38.91\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .141\). However, the
interaction was not significant,
\(F(2, 238) = 2.16\), \(p = .118\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .018\). The difference between
the anecdote only condition and the anecdote \& enhanced statistics condition was
not significant, \(M = -9.24\), 95\% CI \([-22.00,~3.51]\), \(t(238) = -1.43\), \(p = .155\).

\subsubsection{Manipulation Check}

Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-similarity-rating} shows participants' ratings
of the similarity of the anecdote to the target project. As intended,
participants in the high similarity condition rated the anecdote as more similar
to the target project than those in the low similarity condition,
\(F(1, 238) = 27.01\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .102\).

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Follow-up}

Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-relevance-specific} shows participants'
ratings of the specific relevance question. There was no significant effect of
evidence type \(F(2, 238) = 0.96\), \(p = .383\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .008\); or
similarity, \(F(1, 238) = 1.54\), \(p = .216\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .006\). The
interaction was also not significant, \texttt{r\ results\_anecdotes\_1\$relevance\_specific\$anecdote\_alignment}.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-relevance-general} shows participants' ratings
of the general relevance question. There was no main effect of similarity,
\(F(1, 238) = 3.32\), \(p = .070\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .014\), or interaction of
similarity and evidence type, \texttt{r\ results\_anecdotes\_1\$relevance\_general\$anecdote\_alignment}. However, there was an
unexpected main effect of evidence type,
\(F(2, 238) = 3.80\), \(p = .024\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .031\). A contrast analysis with
Bonferroni correction revealed that the anecdote only condition was rated
significantly higher than the anecdote \& statistics condition,
\(\Delta M = 0.58\), 95\% CI \([0.06,~1.10]\), \(t(238) = 2.71\), \(p = .022\). However, the
difference between the two anecdote \& statistics conditions was not significant,
\(\Delta M = -0.39\), 95\% CI \([-0.90,~0.13]\), \(t(238) = -1.81\), \(p = .212\).

\end{figure}

Regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between
allocations and the follow-up ratings of similarity and relevance. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-lm-allocation-similarity}, similarity ratings
were negatively correlated to allocations,
\(b = -3.53\), 95\% CI \([-5.70, -1.37]\), \(t(242) = -3.21\), \(p = .002\). Finally, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-anecdotes-1-lm-relevance-specific-similarity} similarity
ratings were positively correlated to specific relevance ratings,
\(b = 0.30\), 95\% CI \([0.17, 0.43]\), \(t(242) = 4.59\), \(p < .001\).

\hypertarget{power-analysis-anecdotes-2}{%
\paragraph{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis-anecdotes-2}}

A power analysis was conducted through simulation of the effects implied by the
hypotheses in Experiment~2. Data were simulated with the same mean values as
Experiment~1 for the effects that were previously significant (i.e., similarity,
statistics, and interaction effects), and no effect for the differences that
were non-significant (as shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:plot-simulation-anecdotes-2-negative}
and~\ref{fig:plot-simulation-anecdotes-2-positive}). The null effect was
analysed using the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure, or \emph{equivalence}
testing \autocite{lakens2018}, and setting the smallest effect size of interest to the
smallest difference that leads to a significant equivalence between the combined
low similarity and statistics only conditions in Experiment~1.
Figure~\ref{fig:power-analysis-anecdotes-2} shows the results of this analysis,
which suggested a total sample size of 92
(46 \(\times\) 2).

The following were counterbalanced: (a) project variation (five latin square
variations), which is the association of each display content with each
within-subject condition; and (b) anecdote variation (two variations), which is
the association of each project display and being either the target or
comparison project. Table column order and project display order were
randomised.

\subsection{Results}\label{results-anecdotes-2-appendix}}

\subsubsection{Allocation}

\paragraph{Similarity Manipulation Check}

The similarity manipulation worked as expected, with the negative anecdote only
low similarity condition being allocated significantly more than those in the
high similarity condition,
\(\Delta M = 26.98\), 95\% CI \([18.12,~35.84]\), \(t(186.55) = 6.01\), \(p < .001\). For positive
anecdotes, participants allocated more to the high similarity condition than
those in the low similarity condition,
\(\Delta M = -22.62\), 95\% CI \([-31.48,~-13.77]\), \(t(186.55) = -5.04\), \(p < .001\)

\subsubsection{Ratings}

\paragraph{Similarity Manipulation Check}

Evidence for the similarity manipulation working was also seen in the rating
data. Participants rated anecdotes in the high similarity condition as more
similar to the target than those in the low similarity condition,
\(F(1, 94) = 48.36\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .340\).

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Allocation is Influenced by Perceived Similarity}

As hypothesised, allocation was influenced by perceived similarity. That is, in
the negative valence condition, there was a negative correlation between
allocation and similarity rating,
\(\Delta M = 0.34\), 95\% CI \([-3.72,~4.39]\), \(t(376) = 0.16\), \(p = .870\).
However, in the positive valence condition,
there was a positive correlation between allocation and similarity rating,
\(\Delta M = 2.86\), 95\% CI \([-1.47,~7.18]\), \(t(376) = 1.30\), \(p = .195\).

\paragraph{The Relationship Between Allocation and Specific-Relevance Depends on Similarity}

In the negative valence condition, there was no significant difference between
the slopes of the high and low similarity conditions,
\(M = -2.02\), 95\% CI \([-6.44,~2.41]\), \(t(376) = -0.90\), \(p = .371\).
In the low similarity condition, allocation and specific-relevance rating were
not correlated,
\(\Delta M = 1.01\), 95\% CI \([-1.21,~3.22]\), \(t(376) = 0.90\), \(p = .371\),
as in the low similarity condition,
\(\Delta M = -1.01\), 95\% CI \([-3.22,~1.21]\), \(t(376) = -0.90\), \(p = .371\).

In the positive valence condition, there was no significant difference between
the slopes of the high and low similarity conditions,
\(M = 4.25\), 95\% CI \([-0.20,~8.70]\), \(t(376) = 1.88\), \(p = .061\).
In the low similarity condition, allocation and specific-relevance rating were
not correlated,
\(\Delta M = -2.12\), 95\% CI \([-4.35,~0.10]\), \(t(376) = -1.88\), \(p = .061\),
as in the low similarity condition,
\(\Delta M = 2.12\), 95\% CI \([-0.10,~4.35]\), \(t(376) = 1.88\), \(p = .061\).

\paragraph{People do not Consider General-Relevance in Their Allocation}

There were no significant correlations between allocation and general-relevance
rating.
