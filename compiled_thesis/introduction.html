<!-- Organisations have a big impact on the world -->
<p>Much of modern life depends on large organisations. General Electric (GE) makes
the engines that power our aircrafts, Johnson &amp; Johnson makes our shampoo, and
Google allows us to search the internet. The areas of our lives that are less
affected by such private firms depend on public sector organisations such as
public hospitals, schools, and police. The justification for the existence of
organisations of this size is that the particular combination of individual
divisions, alongside a corporate management, will lead to better performance for
each of the divisions than they would have been able to generate individually.
In other words, the assumption is that such organisations create a synergy—the
quality of the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<!-- They are made up of multiple divisions -->
<p>Multi-divisional organisations are typically organised in a hierarchical
structure, with a corporate management team and subsidiary divisions. Each
division can be made up of several business units. For instance, some of GE’s
divisions include GE Aviation and GE Healthcare. Similarly, in the public
sector, a hospital system may operate through multiple individual hospitals in
different regions.</p>
<!-- This means capital allocation -->
<p>Such organisations therefore need to make capital allocation decisions. That is,
given a limited amount of financial resources, how best to invest in the
multiple divisions? Equally? Pick a winner? What metric should be used to
compare across divisions? Capital allocation is a critical process to the
operation and development of multi-divisional organisations.</p>
<!-- Many decisions come from one or few people -->
<p>The products and services that arise from organisations are necessarily a result
of the work of many people. In GE, for instance, the factories that generate
aircraft engines need to be staffed by production line workers, accountants are
needed for bookkeeping, and software engineers are needed to design and maintain
the production systems. Despite this, many important strategic decisions
ultimately come from a very small number of people. The decisions that the CEO
or other lower level executives make can have large consequences on the life of
the company.</p>
<!-- Managers are biased -->
<p>It is often assumed that a few people having a lot of decision-making power is
for the best. Managers of large organisations often appear to be bold and
effective decision-makers. It appears that their position of power and wealth
was necessarily arrived at through high competence and rational decision-making,
suggesting that the organisation is in good hands. However, there are three
reasons why it may be concerning that much of an organisation’s future—and by
extension often many more components of the economy—depends on the decisions
of a few individual. First, the role of survivorship bias in obtaining the
manager’s role is unclear, because the number of managers that used the same
management strategy and failed is unknown. Second, decades of work have shown
that people’s decision-making is often fallible and that job experience does not
always alleviate this fallibility. Third, managers of large organisations often
face uncertain environments, which increases the likelihood of managers facing
psychological biases.</p>
<p>There are many examples of companies that suffered due to such biases.
Overconfidence and confirmation bias likely played a part in Blockbuster’s
famous refusal of an offer to buy Netflix in 2000 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-meissner2015" role="doc-biblioref">Meissner et al., 2015</a>)</span>. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-roxburgh2003" role="doc-biblioref">Roxburgh</a> (<a href="#ref-roxburgh2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>
identified how Equitable Life Assurance Society unnecessarily anchored on
previous interest rate performance and was unprepared when rates changed. In an
example of the sunk-cost fallacy, the London Stock Exchange continued investing
in an automated-settlement system even when it no longer remained profitable.
The Bank of England needed to step in and stop the project. Overconfidence in
market entry is also a common issue, illustrated by EMI’s introduction into the
medical-diagnostics market with the CT scanner <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-camerer1999" role="doc-biblioref">Camerer &amp; Lovallo, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref-horn2005" role="doc-biblioref">Horn et al., 2005</a>)</span>. By
underestimating the competition and overestimating their own capabilities they
eventually incurred losses and exited the market.</p>
<!-- Not enough work on capital allocation biases -->
<p>One class of biases has not been well studied: capital allocation biases. While
some previous work investigating these biases exists <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-bardolet2011" role="doc-biblioref">Bardolet et al., 2011</a>)</span>, many
questions still remain unanswered. This is a rather large hole in the literature
because capital allocation decisions are at the centre of executive and lower
level managers’ roles. When making capital allocation decisions, there are
elements of the decision-making environment that can be deceiving for managers.
This thesis examines how the framing of a series of business projects affects
people’s decisions about those projects. Specifically, the same set of projects,
presented in aggregate form, is much more likely to be accepted. Further,
sometimes people are distracted by extraneous semantic information, such as the
relative similarity of the options.</p>
<p>The results of the thesis show that although people in general make sensible
decisions, they fail to moderate them appropriately when presented with critical
information. Specifically, information about metric variance is ignored even
when other metrics are available. Further, people seem to appropriately use
statistical and anecdotal information based on relevance to the situation at
hand, but ignore information about the sampling of the anecdote. Not
appropriately using these kinds of statistical concepts has important
financial consequences, discussed below.</p>
<p>All the experiments in the thesis use laypeople, except for one experiment.
However, past work generally shows the same biases in managers and laypeople
<span class="citation">(with some showing more bias in managers, e.g., <a href="#ref-haigh2005" role="doc-biblioref">Haigh &amp; List, 2005</a>)</span>. Further, upcoming
studies will directly test managers to determine any potential expertise
effects.</p>
<p>Section <a href="introduction.html#capital-allocation">1.1</a> will explain how the capital allocation
process functions in hierarchical organisations and why it is necessary to
analyse such a process with a psychological approach. Section <a href="introduction.html#psychology">1.2</a>
reviews the literature on decision-making biases and how these may apply to
capital allocation decisions. Section <a href="introduction.html#chapter-overview">1.3</a> will then
summarise the rest of the thesis chapters.</p>

</h2>
<!-- Large organisations have hierarchies -->
<p>The purpose of a multi-divisional organisation is to generate more value than
any of the individual divisions combined. The whole should be greater than the
sum of its parts. Previous work suggests that this is achieved due to factors
such as reduced transaction costs <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coase1937" role="doc-biblioref">Coase, 1937</a>; <a href="#ref-liebeskind2000" role="doc-biblioref">Liebeskind, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-teece1982" role="doc-biblioref">Teece, 1982</a>, <a href="#ref-teece1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>; <a href="#ref-williamson1981" role="doc-biblioref">Williamson, 1981</a>)</span>, shared resources <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barney1991" role="doc-biblioref">Barney, 1991</a>; <a href="#ref-wernerfelt1984" role="doc-biblioref">Wernerfelt, 1984</a>)</span>,
increased competitive advantage <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-porter1980" role="doc-biblioref">Porter, 1980</a>, <a href="#ref-porter1985" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span>, increased monitoring
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gertner1994" role="doc-biblioref">Gertner et al., 1994</a>)</span>, and increased synergies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barney1988" role="doc-biblioref">Barney, 1988</a>)</span>. The underlying logic is
the same: a multi-divisional organisation will be successful if it manages its
divisions using processes and resources that are shared or, better yet, are
complementary.</p>
<!-- Managers evaluate projects to potentially invest in -->
<p>In order to successfully manage multiple units, large organisations developed a
hierarchical structure. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-bower1970" role="doc-biblioref">Bower</a> (<a href="#ref-bower1970" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span> identified three levels of the typical
management hierarchy: business, division, and corporate. These are equivalent to
front-line (or bottom), middle, and top level managers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-noda1996" role="doc-biblioref">Noda &amp; Bower, 1996</a>)</span>. Early
theorists suggested that the strategy for the organisation’s growth is driven
completely by the top managers; the rest of the organisation simply enacts their
proposals. However, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mintzberg1985" role="doc-biblioref">Mintzberg &amp; Waters</a> (<a href="#ref-mintzberg1985" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span> emphasised the role of an emergent strategy,
in which lower level managers affect change in the organisation’s strategy.
Other work proposed and found evidence for an iterated process in which a
strategic context may be set by top managers, but business projects advanced by
lower level managers also contribute to driving the strategy of the organisation
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bower1970" role="doc-biblioref">Bower, 1970</a>; <a href="#ref-burgelman1983" role="doc-biblioref">Burgelman, 1983</a>; <a href="#ref-noda1996" role="doc-biblioref">Noda &amp; Bower, 1996</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The way that capital is allocated in an organisation is very important to its
growth and longevity. This process is a part of the broader process of resource
allocation. A <em>resource</em> can refer to many types of assets that an organisation
owns, both tangible and intangible, of which capital is only one
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wernerfelt1984" role="doc-biblioref">Wernerfelt, 1984</a>)</span>. The capital allocation process itself is an important driver
of the strategic outcomes of an organisation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bower1970" role="doc-biblioref">Bower, 1970</a>; <a href="#ref-bower2005" role="doc-biblioref">Bower &amp; Gilbert, 2005</a>)</span>, and as a
result, is an important influence on its financial performance <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-arrfelt2015" role="doc-biblioref">Arrfelt et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-bardolet2010" role="doc-biblioref">Bardolet et al., 2010</a>)</span>. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-sengul2019" role="doc-biblioref">Sengul et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-sengul2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019, p. 72</a>)</span> describe intra-firm capital
allocation as “(i) a process of determination, comparison, and selection among
multiple investment alternatives, (ii) taking place across organizational levels
of the firm, and (iii) influenced and constrained by the external context in
which the firm is situated.” In capital allocation, business-level managers
typically formulate project proposals, which their division managers then
evaluate. The division managers then choose the projects to send for final
approval with the corporate managers. The supply of available capital is also
influenced by external sources such as investors, competitors, and customers.
However, this thesis focuses on the comparison and selection processes that are
relevant during business project evaluation.</p>
<!-- They have limited information -->
<p>Managers ultimately have only limited information about the projects that they
evaluate. They typically have access to descriptive information about the
investment and its known properties, but also are provided with financial
metrics that estimate the returns on the investment. There are many such
metrics; they usually attempt to encapsulate a trade-off between predicted
future gains, present losses (in the form of the capital spent to pay for the
investment), and opportunity costs. Examples include Net Present Value (NPV),
Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Return on Investment (ROI), Cost-Benefit (CB),
and Pay-Back Period (PBP). This thesis focuses on NPV, since it is one of the
most frequently used metrics for project evaluation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-graham2015" role="doc-biblioref">Graham et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-graham2001" role="doc-biblioref">Graham &amp; Harvey, 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-remer1993" role="doc-biblioref">Remer et al., 1993</a>)</span>. NPV is the difference between the money that a project is
forecasted to make and the initial investment in its development (accounting for
the time value of money), as seen in Equation <a href="introduction.html#eq:npv">(1.1)</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:npv">\[\begin{equation}
\text{NPV}=\sum_{t=0}^n \frac{R_t}{(1+i)^t}, \tag{1.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the time of the cash flow, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the discount rate, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is the
net cash flow, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of periods. NPV is a useful metric
because simply knowing that it is positive suggests that the project that it
describes should be profitable. Therefore, metrics such as these have a strong
influence on the decision of the manager evaluating a project.</p>
<!-- Influences on the decision -->
<p>However, there are other influences on project evaluations other than the value
of the financial metrics. For instance, politics within or outside the company
can lead to situations in which a decision is based on social influence or even
manipulation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-garbuio2017" role="doc-biblioref">Garbuio &amp; Lovallo, 2017</a>)</span>. Such influence is not necessarily negative; it may
involve qualitative feedback from, for instance, a more senior manager
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thamhain2014" role="doc-biblioref">Thamhain, 2014</a>)</span>. Research has also shown that the media can have a tangible
influence on managerial decision-making <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bednar2013" role="doc-biblioref">Bednar et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-liu2013" role="doc-biblioref">B. Liu &amp; McConnell, 2013</a>)</span>. Other sources
of influence are the organisational structures and incentives that are in place
both externally <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kokkinis2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kokkinis, 2019</a>)</span> and internally to the organisation
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rajan2000" role="doc-biblioref">Rajan et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-ullrich2004" role="doc-biblioref">Ullrich &amp; Tuttle, 2004</a>)</span>. Such dynamics have also been the subject of economic
modelling investigations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cavagnac2005" role="doc-biblioref">Cavagnac, 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-ortner2017" role="doc-biblioref">Ortner et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-reichelstein1997" role="doc-biblioref">Reichelstein, 1997</a>)</span>.
Project proposals might also be affected by certain approval structures. For
instance, managers might submit overly-optimistic project proposals if they know
that the corporate team only accepts projects with a certain minimum NPV
forecast.</p>
<p>Another potential organisational influence on capital allocation is the extent
of diversification present in an organisation. A diversified organisation is one
that possesses different divisions that are unrelated in some way. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-penrose2009" role="doc-biblioref">Penrose</a> (<a href="#ref-penrose2009" role="doc-biblioref">1959/2009, p. 96</a>)</span> defined it as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a firm diversifies its productive activities whenever, without entirely
abandoning its old lines of product, it embarks upon the production of new
products, including intermediate products, which are sufficiently different
from the other products it produces to imply some significant difference in
the firm’s production or distribution programmes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previous work found that organisations that are made up of more related
divisions are more successful than those that are made up of unrelated divisions
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-harrison1993" role="doc-biblioref">Harrison et al., 1993</a>; <a href="#ref-rumelt1974" role="doc-biblioref">Rumelt, 1974</a>; <a href="#ref-shelton1988" role="doc-biblioref">Shelton, 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-wernerfelt1988" role="doc-biblioref">Wernerfelt &amp; Montgomery, 1988</a>)</span>. This is also true
within business divisions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davis1992" role="doc-biblioref">P. S. Davis et al., 1992</a>)</span>. However, <em>more</em> diversified firms have
also been shown to be associated with profitability <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grant1988" role="doc-biblioref">Grant &amp; Jammine, 1988</a>)</span>. This is
usually explained by the ability for such firms to avoid risk associated with
any one market. Some of the discrepancy in diversification findings has been
explained to be due to the specific measures used <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lubatkin1986" role="doc-biblioref">Lubatkin &amp; Shrieves, 1986</a>)</span>. It may also
be because most studies used Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes to
measure diversification <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-rumelt1974" role="doc-biblioref">Rumelt, 1974</a>)</span>, whereas others operationalised it
using other approaches <span class="citation">(e.g., resource-based; <a href="#ref-harrison1993" role="doc-biblioref">Harrison et al., 1993</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The advantage that related organisations have had has been explained through
<em>synergies</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barney1988" role="doc-biblioref">Barney, 1988</a>)</span>. That is, an organisation with two divisions that can
use their resources to better one another are better off together than
separately. The 1960s saw a general rise in mergers and acquisitions from
executives seeking to diversify their organisations. However, doing so simply
for the sake of increasing divisions, rather than an understanding of the
possible synergies, leads to the organisation actually being worth less than the
sum of its parts <span class="citation">(known as a <em>diversification discount</em>; <a href="#ref-lang1994" role="doc-biblioref">Lang &amp; Stulz, 1994</a>)</span>. In fact,
many organisations that acquired other businesses to diversify subsequently end
up divesting them <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-porter1987" role="doc-biblioref">Porter, 1987</a>)</span>. For instance, in 2018 Australian conglomerate
Wesfarmers demerged its Coles division, a successful retailer. Since then, the
share price for both companies has risen by approximately 62% and 32%,
respectively <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-boyd2021" role="doc-biblioref">Boyd, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>While much of the performance of an organisation depends on influences that are
external to the individual managers (e.g., organisational, political),
psychological factors are often also quite consequential. For instance, on the
one hand, organisational factors such as relevant support teams and approval
processes may influence capital allocation depending on the extent of an
organisation’s extent of diversification. On the other hand, psychological
factors such as ability of managers to compare between business project
proposals may also impact allocation differently depending on the organisation’s
diversification. It is likely to be more difficult for a manager to evaluate
project proposals from two dissimilar divisions that it is to evaluate those
from two similar divisions. The organisational influences discussed above often
assume that the manager that is making the decisions acts rationally, as per
traditional economic theory. However, surveys of executives show that CEOs and
CFOs often rely on non-financial factors for capital allocation decisions
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-graham2015" role="doc-biblioref">Graham et al., 2015</a>)</span>. Executives in these surveys identified manager reputation and
confidence as two of the most important factors for capital allocation
decisions. Further, research in psychology has shown that cognitive biases can
influence such capital allocation decisions. Section <a href="introduction.html#psychology">1.2</a> discusses
such biases and the relevant implications for the thesis.</p>

<p>Managers of large organisations are generally assumed to have a superior
decision-making capability to non-managers. However, managerial decision-making
involves many of the same processes that have been shown to be affected by
psychological biases in the general population <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-das1999" role="doc-biblioref">Das &amp; Teng, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref-mccray2002" role="doc-biblioref">McCray et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-schwenk1984" role="doc-biblioref">Schwenk, 1984</a>)</span>. Further, an organisation’s success ultimately depends on strategic
decisions made by top level managers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mazzolini1981" role="doc-biblioref">Mazzolini, 1981</a>)</span>. Therefore, despite early
work attempting to analyse such decisions using a structured organisational
analysis <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-mintzberg1976" role="doc-biblioref">Mintzberg et al., 1976</a>)</span>, it is important to understand the potential
influence of psychological biases on managerial decisions. Research in the field
of behavioural strategy has started to do this <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-powell2011" role="doc-biblioref">Powell et al., 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Psychological research has shown that people tend to make decisions that are
inconsistent with neoclassical economic theory. For instance, Expected Utility
Theory <span class="citation">(EUT; <a href="#ref-friedman1948" role="doc-biblioref">Friedman &amp; Savage, 1948</a>; <a href="#ref-vonneumann1944" role="doc-biblioref">von Neumann et al., 1944</a>)</span> assumed that people have complete
information when making decisions. However, both laypeople and managers of
organisations are limited in the amount of information that they have and their

<!-- Previous research -->
<p>Research has shown many ways in which the allocation of capital in an
organisation can be influenced by psychological biases. For instance,
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-benartzi2001" role="doc-biblioref">Benartzi &amp; Thaler</a> (<a href="#ref-benartzi2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> found that people tend to allocate their retirement fund equally
between the available options, regardless of their composition. This <em>naive
diversification</em> bias was also found in capital allocation for hierarchical
firms <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bardolet2011" role="doc-biblioref">Bardolet et al., 2011</a>)</span>. Managers allocated capital equally across the available
divisions in the firm, regardless of performance. Analysis of real companies
found that this behaviour is damaging to firm performance because it means that
lower performing business units get subsidised by higher performing units, which
are not operating at their full potential <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-arrfelt2015" role="doc-biblioref">Arrfelt et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-bardolet2010" role="doc-biblioref">Bardolet et al., 2010</a>)</span>.
Subsequent studies found that business unit size also matters; capital
allocation to both the smallest and largest units is disproportionate to their
actual profitability levels <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bardolet2017" role="doc-biblioref">Bardolet et al., 2017</a>)</span>. This was attributed to a
combination of naive diversification and political power effects.</p>
<p>Relatedly, people tend to continue expending capital into investments that
appear to be failing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-staw1981" role="doc-biblioref">Staw, 1981</a>)</span>. This <em>escalating commitment</em> is another way
that psychological biases can influence allocation in an organisation. This
pattern of decision-making is likely a consequence of the sunk cost fallacy, in
which people avoid “cutting their losses” even when they know that they cannot
recuperate an investment <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-parayre1995" role="doc-biblioref">Parayre, 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Managers also do not always seem to seek profit maximisation. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-shapira2014" role="doc-biblioref">Shapira &amp; Shaver</a> (<a href="#ref-shapira2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>
offered managers and MBA students two investment from a hypothetical firm: one
with the same expected returns as the average of the firm’s current investments
and one with lower returns than the firm’s average returns. However, both
investments were profitable, so to maximise firm profits both should be chosen.
Instead, participants were more likely to only choose the first investment. It
seems that the firm’s average returns served as an anchor, so participants did
not want to reduce the firm’s average returns, regardless of profitability.</p>
<p>The way that information is presented can also influence allocations. For
instance, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-yates1978" role="doc-biblioref">Yates et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-yates1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span> showed that people’s evaluations are sensitive to the level
of detail in the information provided. They found that people devalued
descriptions of university courses more when they had less detail. This may be
relevant for managers evaluating project proposals. A proposal might appear more
attractive simply due to the level of detail in it, even if the level of detail
does not correspond with the quality of each proposal.</p>
<p>Further, people tend to be over-confident in their decisions and forecasts. This
has been shown in laypeople <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-langer1975" role="doc-biblioref">E. J. Langer, 1975</a>; <a href="#ref-mannes2013" role="doc-biblioref">Mannes &amp; Moore, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-puri2007" role="doc-biblioref">Puri &amp; Robinson, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-soll2004" role="doc-biblioref">Soll &amp; Klayman, 2004</a>)</span>, as
well as in IT professionals <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mckenzie2008" role="doc-biblioref">McKenzie et al., 2008</a>)</span> and managers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baroneadesi2013" role="doc-biblioref">Barone-Adesi et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-kahneman1993" role="doc-biblioref">Kahneman &amp; Lovallo, 1993</a>; <a href="#ref-lovallo2003" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo &amp; Kahneman, 2003</a>)</span>. This is important for higher-level managers
that evaluate project proposals because the metrics that rely on forecast
estimates may be biased by the over-confidence of the lower-level manager that
created the proposal. Further, the higher-level manager evaluating the proposal
may in turn be over-confident about its prospects due to factors that are
unrelated to the underlying value. Overconfidence is also seen when considering
the success of projects in hindsight <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bukszar1988" role="doc-biblioref">Bukszar &amp; Connolly, 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-christensenszalanski1991" role="doc-biblioref">Christensen-Szalanski &amp; Willham, 1991</a>)</span>.
This means that it less likely that managers will be able to effectively learn
from both past mistakes and successes due to the potentially erroneous belief
that the outcome was anticipated.</p>
<p>Managers often create sensitivity analyses, estimating the worst case, best
case, and most likely scenario for a forecast. However, these are likely to be
anchored on past experiences that further the manager’s existing beliefs. In
fact, prior research has shown that people are poor at constructing subjective
probability distributions <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-alpert1982" role="doc-biblioref">Alpert &amp; Raiffa, 1982</a>; <a href="#ref-schaefer1973" role="doc-biblioref">Schaefer &amp; Borcherding, 1973</a>; <a href="#ref-tversky1974" role="doc-biblioref">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974</a>; <a href="#ref-staelvonholstein1971" role="doc-biblioref">von Holstein, 1971</a>)</span>. Therefore, this suggests that even if the
lower-level managers that construct project proposals calibrate their forecasts
so that they are not over-confident, they are still likely to provide inaccurate
estimates of their degree of confidence.</p>
<p>The above summarises many of the currently known psychological biases related to
capital allocation. This thesis focuses on three essential processes within the
capital allocation process: 1. risky choice, 2. the comparison between
diversified businesses, and 3. the influence of prior experience. Each of these
is prone to separate biases, that are also interrelated. The subsequent
subsections review the literature for these processes.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Risky choice<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#risky-choice"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<!-- Utility -->
<p>Neoclassical theories such as EUT suggest that when faced with multiple risky
options people should choose the option with the highest Expected Value (EV),
all else being equal. This means multiplying the value of each option by its
probability and comparing the resulting values <span class="citation">(first documented in <a href="#ref-pascal1999" role="doc-biblioref">Pascal, 1670/1999</a>)</span>. For instance, imagine being presented with the following two
choices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><p>a gamble that involves a 50% chance gaining $200 and a 50% chance of losing
$100; or</p></li>
<li><p>gaining/losing nothing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In option A, the EV is calculated as <span class="math inline">\(200 \cdot 0.5 - 100 \cdot 0.5 = 50\)</span>. Since
the EV for option A (50) is higher than the EV for option B (0), EUT would
suggest that option A should be chosen.</p>
<p>This basic principle was extended by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-bernoulli1954" role="doc-biblioref">Bernoulli</a> (<a href="#ref-bernoulli1954" role="doc-biblioref">1738/1954</a>)</span>, who suggested that a
persons’ subjective value of money differs depending on their current wealth.
This <em>diminishing marginal utility</em> suggests that the more money a person
already has, the less value acquiring more money will have for him. For example,
the experience of a rich man that finds $10 on the street is very different to
the experience of a homeless man that finds $10 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bradley2013" role="doc-biblioref">Bradley, 2013</a>)</span>. Even though $10
was gained in both cases, $10 has less value to a person that already has, for
example, $1000, than for a person that initially only has $10. This principle is
usually modelled as an power function (with a fractional exponent).</p>
<!-- Prospect theory -->
<p>Prospect theory <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kahneman1979" role="doc-biblioref">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</a>; <a href="#ref-tversky1992" role="doc-biblioref">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992</a>)</span> challenged EUT by suggesting that
people’s subjective value of money does not depend on their state of wealth—it
depends on a change of wealth from a reference point. This is important because
people’s subjective value of money is different depending if they are gaining or
losing money. Specifically, losses have a stronger psychological impact than
equivalent gains. This disparity is one of the most settled and consistent
findings in psychology and economics, having been well-replicated <span class="citation">(e.g, <a href="#ref-ruggeri2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ruggeri et al., 2020</a>)</span>. The fact that losses loom more than equivalent gains for the vast
majority of people is referred to as <em>loss aversion</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kahneman1979" role="doc-biblioref">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</a>)</span>. This
finding was the primary reason that Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in
Economics in 2002 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kahneman2003" role="doc-biblioref">Kahneman, 2003</a>)</span>. Loss aversion has been found with small
amounts of money in experimental settings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kahneman1979" role="doc-biblioref">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</a>; <a href="#ref-tversky1992" role="doc-biblioref">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992</a>)</span> and with
millions of dollars in corporate settings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-koller2012" role="doc-biblioref">Koller et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-swalm1966" role="doc-biblioref">Swalm, 1966</a>)</span>. The effect
has been found in young children <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-harbaugh2001" role="doc-biblioref">Harbaugh et al., 2001</a>)</span>, the numerous disparate
cultures in which it has been tested <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-weber1998" role="doc-biblioref">Weber &amp; Hsee, 1998</a>)</span>, and even in capuchin monkeys
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chen2006a" role="doc-biblioref">Chen et al., 2006</a>)</span>. Furthermore, a neural basis for loss aversion was identified
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tom2007" role="doc-biblioref">Tom et al., 2007</a>)</span>. Therefore, loss aversion is clearly central to human cognition and
behaviour.</p>
<p>The function that represents the value of a prospect describes both loss
aversion and diminishing marginal utility, as seen in
Equation <a href="introduction.html#eq:value-function">(1.2)</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:value-function">\[\begin{equation} v(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l} x^\alpha \text{ if } x \ge 0 \\
-\lambda(-x)^\beta \text{ if } x &lt; 0, \tag{1.2} \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the possible outcome, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> represents the loss aversion
coefficient, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> represent the diminishing marginal utility
for gains and losses, respectively.</p>
<p>In other words, loss aversion means that losses have more impact than equivalent
gains. In fact, the impact of loss aversion can be expressed even more
precisely, as a measurement of the ratio of the slopes of the curve for gains
and losses. This measure tells us the average amount that losses have more
impact than equivalent gains. In a sequel to the original prospect theory paper,
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-tversky1992" role="doc-biblioref">Tversky &amp; Kahneman</a> (<a href="#ref-tversky1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> measured a median coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) of 2.25 of loss aversion.
This means that people respond to losses 2.25 times more than equivalent gains.
Similarly, this paper measured a median exponent (representing diminishing
marginal utility, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>) of 0.88 for both gains and losses. This
means that people discount money the more of it they have by a rate of
<span class="math inline">\(x^{0.88}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:prospect-theory">1.1</a> shows loss aversion as the function being
steeper in the domain of losses than the domain of gains. It shows diminishing
marginal utility by the slight curve of the function. Equivalent changes in
actual wealth from the references point (x-axis) have different impacts on the
changes’ subjective value (y-axis). An increase in wealth (<span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span>) brings about
an equivalent increase of value (<span class="math inline">\(y = 1^{0.88} = 1\)</span>). However, a decrease in the
same amount of wealth (<span class="math inline">\(x = -1\)</span>) brings about a decrease in value 2.25 times the
value of the equivalent gain (<span class="math inline">\(y = -2.25 \cdot (-(-1))^{0.88} = -2.25\)</span>).</p>

<!-- Management connection -->
<p>This research is relevant to capital allocation because the project proposals
that managers evaluate invariably involve an element of risk. Therefore,
managers are likely to be affected by similar effects on risk that have been
shown in laypeople. However, hierarchical organisations offer an even more
complex situation. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> found that the risk profiles of lower-level
managers are lower than those of the top managers. They suggest that this may be
due to lower-level managers’ loss aversion to accepting projects that may
jeopardise their job. However, the top managers recognise that a loss in one or
more business units is likely to be offset by gains in other units. Such an
inconsistency in risk profiles across the levels of an hierarchical organisation
fails to take advantage of the benefits of risk aggregation, which has long been
understood in external markets <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-markowitz1952" role="doc-biblioref">Markowitz, 1952</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> suggested that lower-level managers’ failure to aggregate risk to
the degree desired by top executives is costing companies approximately a third
of the total EV of new project proposals. This is an example of a negative
consequence associated with ignoring statistical concepts such as risk
aggregation. It is thus critical to identify ways to support risk aggregation
across organisational hierarchies. The psychological literature shows that
people’s risk aggregation is facilitated through various choice bracketing
manipulations. However, there has been no work that investigated such situations
without providing participants with feedback in between decisions; this
critically limits the external validity of this work because in the real world,
organisations evaluate several projects before seeing the outcomes of any one
decision. The experiments presented in Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> investigate
the effects of choice bracketing on risk aggregation without feedback.</p>

<div id="project-similarity" class="section level3" number="1.2.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Project similarity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-similarity"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>When evaluating project proposals, managers are likely to be influenced by the
relative similarity of the available options to each other. The extent to which
this may be true is important especially since the increase firm
diversification. Organisations are not only varied by the number of divisions
which they possess, but also by the extent of diversification. This means that
managers are likely to find themselves comparing across dissimilar types of
projects.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are likely many organisational and financial reasons
why the extent of diversification in an organisation would impact its
performance. However, the impact of psychological factors has not been
investigated. Specifically, project similarity, which is an organisational
factor, is likely to affect the project comparison process, which is a
psychological factor. This may then have downstream consequences on firm
performance through, for instance, the kinds of financial metrics that are used
and how they are evaluated. Having more similar projects to compare may mean
more attributes on which to evaluate, whereas a dissimilar comparison may lead
to a situation in which a manager has to rely on potentially unreliable metrics.</p>
<p>Structure-mapping theory <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner, 1983</a>; SMT; <a href="#ref-gentner1997" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner &amp; Markman, 1997</a>)</span> provides a model of
comparison that psychologically distinguishes similar and dissimilar allocation
tasks. SMT models comparison as a process of bringing conceptual structures into
alignment which, when possible, puts shared dimensions into correspondence.
Alignment both highlights when two conceptual structures share dimensions, but
also highlights how the two structures differ along those shared dimensions,
called <em>alignable differences</em>. For example, when comparing two oil discovery
projects, all the relevant processes of planning an exploration and measuring
the amount of hydrocarbons in a prospect might be identical, but the specific
amount measured will be different. This is the alignable difference: a
difference between the two projects that is constrained within the same
conceptual structure. However, when comparing between an oil field and a
refinery, there will be significantly more <em>non-alignable differences</em>, because
the two domains do not share component dimensions. That is, many of the
processes that exist in the exploration business unit have a significantly
different dimensional structure to those in the refinery business unit, such
that it will be difficult to find meaningful alignments. More non-alignable
differences mean that there are less opportunities to make meaningful
comparisons, and so would make predicting relative project success and ranking
their priority more difficult. Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> experimentally
examines business project comparisons and how project alignment affects capital
allocation decisions.</p>
<!-- Metric variance -->
<p>When evaluating projects, managers make use of financial metrics, such as NPV.
However, such metrics are reliant on forecast estimates of, for instance, future
cash flows. Do managers take into account such inherent variance in their
decisions? This is especially important to investigate given the above
discussion. In cases of non-alignable comparison managers may rely on a
potentially unreliable metric. On the other hand, in an alignable comparison,
managers might have the option to moderate their choice based on the relative
reliability of different metrics. It is important to remember that all such
decisions are often very consequential for the manager. That is, the project
could ultimately make the company money and lead to future opportunities for the
manager, or potentially cause financial harm to the company (and subsequently
lead to a job loss). This is another example of the way in which ignoring
certain statistical concepts—here metric variance—can have negative
consequences for an organisation.</p>
<p>Psychological research shows that laypeople are in general quite poor at using
numerical variance information <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-batteux2020" role="doc-biblioref">Batteux et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">Konold et al., 1993</a>; <a href="#ref-vivalt2021" role="doc-biblioref">Vivalt &amp; Coville, 2021</a>)</span>. However, it is unclear to what extent managers would be sensitive
to variance information in the metrics associated with the projects that they
evaluate. On the one hand, perhaps managers’ financial training will allow a
consideration of such variance estimates, but this might not manifest in a
situation in which managers have already been shown to be prone to biases.
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> investigates whether people are as sensitive to
verbally-instructed reliability information as they are to numerical reliability
information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Reasoning from past cases<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reasoning-from-past-cases"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Managers often use past events to reason and make predictions about the future
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-einhorn1987" role="doc-biblioref">Einhorn &amp; Hogarth, 1987</a>)</span>. Such past events may be those that happened to the individual
manager, a case from the organisation’s history, or from an external source.
This will especially be the case in a project evaluation scenario when a given
project is hard to compare with the other projects at hand. However, managers
evaluating project proposals may make inappropriate comparisons when considering
the target project to other cases. For instance, when comparing a target problem
to other cases, people tend to limit the size of the comparison set to a small
number. This is often only a handful of cases, or even one. Doing this might
mean only considering potentially irrelevant surface similarity to the current
situation and not aligning the underlying causal structure. Further, this might
mean not considering other similar projects.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-tversky1974" role="doc-biblioref">Tversky &amp; Kahneman</a> (<a href="#ref-tversky1974" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span> discussed a number of biases that may influence such processes. The
availability bias is seen when people mistake the ease of retrieval of
information for its frequency. Further, research on analogical retrieval showed
that people are more likely to retrieve surface similar cases than those with a
relational connection <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gentner1993" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner et al., 1993</a>)</span>. As such, managers are likely to recall
cases that may not be sufficiently relevant to their target situation and be
overly-confident about the frequency of such cases occurring. Such a focus on a
particular case might then also lead to an anchoring effect, wherein other
decisions might be disproportionately seen as relevant. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-tversky1974" role="doc-biblioref">Tversky &amp; Kahneman</a> (<a href="#ref-tversky1974" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span> also found
that people are not sensitive to properties of sample size such as the greater
amount of non-representative outcomes in small samples. This means that managers
are even less likely to appreciate the importance of considering a large sample
of cases when drawing conclusions to a target problem. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-tversky1974" role="doc-biblioref">Tversky &amp; Kahneman</a> (<a href="#ref-tversky1974" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span> also note an
insensitivity to predictability, in which people do not take into account the
reliability of the information that they have to make a prediction. This might
mean that managers may struggle to ideally weigh evidence of varying degrees of
reliability.</p>
<p>External sources that might be used to compare to a target situation include
business case studies. Considering such examples of prior business decisions or
events are the way that most MBAs learn about the business world. Publications
such as Forbes or Harvard Business Review publicise various businesses’
successes and failures and so may create an allure to use such case studies in
the decision-making process. On the other hand, managers may have access to more
aggregated data about their industry from, for instance, consultancy companies.
How do managers use these various types of evidence in their decision-making?</p>
<p>Research on this topic suggests that managers tend to prefer anecdotes over
statistics, unless aided <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg, 2018</a>)</span>. This is a concern because <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gavetti2005" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-gavetti2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>
suggests that managers often make use of case studies quite poorly. The analogy
literature draws a distinction between surface similarity, in which a mapping is
made between easily identifiable but potentially functionally irrelevant
attributes, and relational similarity, in which the underlying mechanism is
considered. Are managers sensitive to the deeper causal mechanisms that underlie
the anecdotes they judge? Or are they simply influenced by surface similarity?
Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> investigates the extent to which people moderate their
reliance on anecdotes or aggregated data by the relevance of the anecdote to the
target project during capital allocation. It also considers whether people are
sensitive to information about the distribution from which the anecdote was
sampled. Ignoring this statistical concept can have negative consequences for an
organisation by potentially over- or under-estimating the relevance of a past
case and therefore making an ill-informed investment.</p>

<p>In sum, the potential consequences of a diversified hierarchical structure are
that business projects will be considered one at a time, and if they are
considered together, disparate project types will make comparisons hard.
Considering projects one by one might mean that risk is not aggregated across
projects and therefore value is lost. The difficultly to compare will lead to
both potentially relying on unreliable metrics, and relying on improper
anecdotal evidence. The thesis is that people often go half-way. They do not
completely disregard the normative strategy, but also struggle to moderate their
decisions when it comes to statistical concepts such as aggregation, variance,
and sampling.</p>
<p>The previous section identified three capital allocation processes that are
currently under-studied and so are important to investigate further. First, the
evaluation of individual project proposals might lead to managers only
considering such projects one at a time, despite the opportunity of aggregating
a portfolio of such projects. The choice bracketing literature suggests that
there are ways of facilitating such aggregation, but does not investigate this
without providing participants inter-trial feedback. Second, in situations in
which managers compare multiple projects, the structural alignment literature
suggests that managers in diversified firms will struggle to allocate capital,
more than those in more integrated firms. Further, these managers might not be
sensitive to the variance inherent in the financial metrics they rely on. Third,
a difficulty to compare across existing projects might instead mean a reliance
on prior case studies from personal or external experience. Research on
anecdotal bias suggests that managers might rely more on such case studies than
on aggregated data, but it is unclear whether they will use anecdote relevance
to moderate their decisions. Further, it is unclear if they will appropriately
use information about the anecdote’s sample distribution.</p>
<p>The rest of this thesis investigates the psychology of capital allocation
decisions in three chapters that describe empirical work, two theoretical
chapters, and a general discussion chapter. Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> describes
two experiments that investigate the effects of choice bracketing on risk
aggregation without feedback. Chapter <a href="interstitial-1.html#interstitial-1">3</a> is a short
theoretical chapter that discusses the difference between evaluating project
proposals with inherent budget estimates and the process of allocating an
existing budget top-down. Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> describes three experiments
that investigate the effects of alignment and reliability type—verbal or
numerical—on allocations. Chapter <a href="interstitial-2.html#interstitial-2">5</a> is another short
theoretical chapter that discusses the trade-offs that people make when using
information to evaluate project proposal options. Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>
describes two experiments that investigate the effects of anecdote similarity on
the anecdotal bias. Finally, Chapter <a href="alignment.html#discussion">4.2.3</a> discusses the theoretical
and practical implications of the empirical chapters and concludes the thesis.</p>
