<p>One of the most important tasks faced by executives is the allocation of capital
within their companies. This requires the ranking of projects by importance and
predicted success, and allocating the limited capital accordingly (not unlike a
scientific funding agency). Ranking of projects necessitates comparing them
across a number of dimensions. For example, the executive of an oil company may
have received multiple oil exploration proposals. Determining what makes one oil
exploration project better than another is relatively simple. However, consider
a different scenario in which the executive must allocate capital between an oil
exploration project and an oil refinery project. The dimensions of oil refinery
projects that distinguish superior from inferior projects may be totally
different from those of oil exploration projects. Consider a funding agency
having to decide between two cognitive scientists or between a cognitive
scientist and a physicist in awarding a fellowship. What makes a physics
proposal better for the field of physics than a cognitive science proposal for
cognitive science?</p>
<p>Structure-mapping theory <span class="citation">(Gentner, <a href="#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>; Gentner &amp; Markman, <a href="#ref-gentner1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> provides a model of
comparison that psychologically distinguishes these two kinds of allocation
tasks. This framework models comparison as a process of mapping and alignment of
the shared dimensions of two conceptual structures. This mapping process reveals
the shared dimensions of the two structures as well as the differences in those
shared dimensions (known as <em>alignable differences</em>). For example, when
comparing two oil exploration projects, the process for measuring the quantity
of hydrocarbons in a prospective oil field may be identical, but the specific
quantities measured will differ. This is known as an alignable difference; that
is, the difference constrained within the same dimension. However, when
comparing an oil field and a refinery, there will be a significantly higher
number of <em>non-alignable differences</em>, because the two domains do not share
component dimensions. That is, the dimensional structure of processes in the
exploration project will be substantially different from that of processes in
the refinery project, making it difficult to find meaningful alignments. With a
higher number of non-alignable differences, there are fewer opportunities to
make meaningful comparisons, leading to greater difficulty in predicting project
success and ranking projects. This chapter experimentally examined project
comparisons and how such comparisons may affect capital allocation decisions.
The working hypothesis is that projects that have a higher number of alignable
differences will lead to more precise and informed project predictions and
rankings compared with projects with non-alignable differences.</p>
<p>However, what happens when a task demands that two domains be aligned but they
are too disparate to align? Experimentally, this territory is somewhat
uncharted. It is expected that, when required, people will grasp at any piece of
information available and attempt to abstract and infer that which is reasonable
to ease the alignment. This occurs frequently in business settings. Because
corporate enterprises continue to embrace diversification strategies in their
investments, they must constantly make capital allocation decisions involving
highly disparate domains. To overcome these difficult comparisons, executives
rely on various financial measures that, in theory, may be applied to any
project or business proposal. These financial measures work well to ease the
burden of difficult comparisons because they ignore the complexities of
individual projects and focus solely on financial information such as total cost
and projected profits. Therefore, projects that are difficult to compare may be
evaluated more easily by comparing individual numerical measures.</p>
<p>The most common financial measure that is used by executives in order to value
business project proposals is NPV <span class="citation">(Graham et al., <a href="#ref-graham2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Graham &amp; Harvey, <a href="#ref-graham2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>; Remer et al., <a href="#ref-remer1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>. NPV is
the difference between the forecasted revenue of a project and the initial
investment in its development (accounting for the time value of money), as shown
in Equation <a href="introduction.html#eq:npv">(1.1)</a>. NPV is commonly used in decisions about capital
allocation and investment. The basic rule is that if a project has a positive
NPV, it is financially viable, and if it has a negative NPV, it is not. However,
the use of NPV has been criticised, by both academics and practitioners
<span class="citation">(Fox, <a href="#ref-fox2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Willigers et al., <a href="#ref-willigers2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. The main criticism is that there can be underlying
sources of variance in NPV that are not reflected in the final measure, which is
expressed as a single numerical value. For instance, NPV is dependent on the
projected cash inflows for each year of the project. However, financial
forecasting is frequently inaccurate and prone to optimism bias <span class="citation">(Lovallo &amp; Kahneman, <a href="#ref-lovallo2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Puri &amp; Robinson, <a href="#ref-puri2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>. Therefore, there is bound to be variation in the reliability of NPV
measures as a function of the forecasting error in the cash flow calculations.
Project duration and the discount rate are further sources of variance that may
be hidden by the single numerical value of NPV.</p>
<p>The secondary goal of this research is to investigate the extent to which people
are sensitive to variance information (from financial forecasting) when making
capital allocation decisions. This consideration is especially important in the
capital allocation situations illustrated above, when executives need to compare
projects with disparate domains and must, therefore, rely on NPV. This matters
because the NPV of different domains may have different underlying forecasting
error, potentially compromising the utility of using NPV as the basis of
comparison. Do executives sufficiently account for the inherent sources of
variance in the measure on which they rely so heavily? Research shows that
people are effective at extracting variance information when exposed to
numerical sequences <span class="citation">(Rosenbaum et al., <a href="#ref-rosenbaum2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. However, they struggle to use variance
information when it is represented numerically <span class="citation">(Batteux et al., <a href="#ref-batteux2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>; Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, <a href="#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>; Konold et al., <a href="#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>; Vivalt &amp; Coville, <a href="#ref-vivalt2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Experiment 1 investigated the effect of project alignment on the decision-making
of naive participants asked to allocate capital to a set of fictional projects.
Naive participants were assumed to have no requisite knowledge about NPV
reliability; thus, NPV reliability level was manipulated by directly telling
participants whether or not the given NPV was reliable. For this experiment, it
was predicted that when projects are alignable, participants who are told NPV is
reliable would use it in their decision-making, while participants who are told
that NPV was unreliable would not use it in their decision-making. However, when
projects are not alignable, it was predicted that participants would use NPV,
regardless of the stated NPV reliability level.</p>
<p>Experiment 2 investigated the decision-making of management students in a
similar situation to Experiment 1. The main difference was that instead of
telling participants whether or not the NPV was reliable, the level of
<em>numerical</em> NPV reliability—that is, the width of the numerical range around
the average NPV—was manipulated. Similar to Experiment 1, it was predicted
that participants would rely more on NPV in non-alignable projects than in
alignable projects. However, it was predicted that numerical reliability level
would have no effect because there is little evidence that people are sensitive
to variance information when it is shown numerically.</p>
<p>Experiment 3 also tested the effects of project alignment and reliability level
in a non-business population but manipulated both verbal and numerical
reliability to enable a direct comparison. The term <em>reliability level</em> is used
to describe the manipulation of whether NPV was expressed as a reliable measure
or not, while <em>reliability type</em> is used to describe the manipulation of whether
reliability was expressed verbally or numerically. Experiment 3 predicted a
reliability level effect for the verbal reliability condition but not the
numerical reliability condition. Further, this experiment used project
descriptions with clearer profitability indicators and added a larger selection
of business industries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Experiment 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alignment-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 1 investigated the effects of project alignment and explicit NPV
reliability information on capital allocation decisions. The structural
alignment literature suggests that people place more weight on alignable
differences than they do on non-alignable differences. It was expected that
participants would rely more on NPV than on other product attributes in their
decision-making because NPV may be applied to every product. However, this
effect should vary with participants’ perceived NPV reliability level. That is,
if other project dimensions are alignable, the use of NPV may depend on its
reliability. However, it was predicted that in projects with low alignment,
there will be a greater reliance on NPV as the sole alignable difference,
regardless of its stated reliability. These effects were measured by considering
the linear relationship between NPV and the money allocated to each project.
Critically, the NPV and intrinsic features of each project shown to participants
were inversely related. Therefore, a positive NPV trend will indicate a heavier
reliance on NPV, whereas a negative trend will indicate a heavier reliance on
the intrinsic project features. First, Experiment 1 tested the following omnibus
hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:three-way-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.1  (overall effect)  </strong></span>The alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability level <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV interaction is
significant.
</div>
<p>Initially, specific effects were tested by excluding the no NPV condition (in
which participants were not given NPV information). Given the difficulty of
comparing dissimilar projects, participants were expected to rely more heavily
on NPV when project attributes are not alignable compared with when they are
alignable. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.2  (alignment effect)  </strong></span>The linear NPV trend will be stronger for projects with low alignment than for
projects with high alignment.
</div>
<p>Participants’ budget allocations were expected to depend on the provided NPV
reliability information. However, this is more likely when there are multiple
aligned metrics from which to choose compared with when NPV only is alignable.
Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.3  (the NPV reliability level effect depends on alignment)  </strong></span>The NPV <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability level interaction will be stronger in the high
alignment than in low alignment.
</div>
<p>Specifically, when projects are similar, it is expected that participants will
rely more on NPV if they are told that NPV is reliable (leading to a positive
NPV trend) but more on the intrinsic features of projects if they are told that
NPV is unreliable (leading to a negative NPV trend). However, when projects are
dissimilar, it is expected that participants will rely solely on NPV, regardless
of what they are told about its reliability. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the
following hypotheses:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.4  (NPV reliability level in high alignment)  </strong></span>When projects have high alignment, the NPV trend will be stronger when NPV
reliability is high compared with when NPV reliability is low.
</div>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.5  (NPV reliability level in low alignment)  </strong></span>When projects have low alignment, the NPV trend will not differ significantly
between the two reliability level conditions.
</div>
<p>A no NPV condition was used to gain a better understanding of participants’
baseline response to materials when they had no information about NPV. The
extent of participants’ reliance on NPV was determined by comparing this no NPV
condition to the conditions in which NPV was present. When projects are similar,
this condition was expected to be equivalent to the low NPV reliability
condition because in this condition participants should disregard NPV. When
projects are dissimilar, this condition was expected to show the average
participant value judgements of the project descriptions, because they only had
the intrinsic project features for their evaluations. This was expected to
result in a flat NPV trend. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following
hypotheses:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-high-no-NPV-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.6  (effect of NPV information for projects with high alignment)  </strong></span>For projects with high alignment, the positive NPV trend will be stronger for
projects with high NPV reliability compared with projects with no NPV
information.
</div>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-low-no-NPV-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.7  (effect of NPV information for projects with low alignment)  </strong></span>For projects with low alignment, the positive NPV trend will be stronger for
projects with both low and high NPV reliability compared with projects with no
NPV information.

<p>Participants, who did not necessarily have business experience, were first shown
an instructions page with information about the task and NPV. These instructions
also informed participants about whether NPV as a financial measure was reliable
or unreliable for the specific project. Participants in the low NPV reliability
level conditions were told that NPV was an unreliable metric, while those in the
high NPV reliability level conditions were told that NPV was a reliable metric.
Instructions provided to participants in the no NPV condition did not include an
explanation of NPV or its reliability. Critically, participants were asked to
invest in products with a high objective value (because a higher-quality product
is not always better in the consumer goods market). Given that participants may
not use this instruction when directly viewing the projects, Experiment 3 used
projects whose attributes inherently expressed their quality.

<p>Participants were provided with a set of fictional business projects to which
they were asked to allocate capital. Alignment manipulation was reinforced
through visual presentation. Projects with high alignment were displayed in a
table listing their various attributes (see
Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:projects-alignment-high-materials-alignment-2">4.1</a>). In this group,
each project involved the same product type with consistent concrete attributes.
The table format was more appropriate for the high alignment condition because
all dimensions were shared. In contrast, projects with low alignment were
presented as paragraphs describing their relevant attributes (see
Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:projects-alignment-low-materials-alignment-2">4.2</a>). In this group,
each project was a different product with concrete attributes specific to that
product. In both alignment conditions, each project description included an NPV.
Critically, the values of the concrete attributes were always in conflict with
the NPV. For instance, Project 4 always had the lowest value for each concrete
attribute but always had the highest NPV. This meant that participants’
allocations could be used as a proxy for their degree of dependence on NPV.</p>
<p>Presentation style was potentially a confounding factor. This was addressed in
Experiment 3 by using the table format for both alignment conditions.</p>

shown in Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:plot-alignment-2-allocation">4.4</a>, the alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>
NPV reliability level <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV interaction was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(6.57, 367.76) = 2.18\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .039\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .038\)</span>. The
analyses excluding the no NPV condition showed the expected results. The NPV
trend averaged across both reliability level conditions was stronger for the low
alignment conditions than for the high alignment conditions,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 61.70\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([33.02,~90.37]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(76) = 4.29\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>. This shows that people
relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar than when they were similar.</p>
<p>Further, the NPV <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV reliability level interaction was stronger in the high
alignment conditions than in the low alignment conditions,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 67.81\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([10.47,~125.16]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(76) = 2.36\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .021\)</span>. Specifically, in
the high alignment conditions, the NPV trend was stronger in the high NPV
reliability condition than in the low NPV reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = -63.47\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-100.00,~-26.94]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = -3.44\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>. In the low alignment
conditions, there was no significant difference between the two
reliability conditions, <span class="math inline">\(M = 4.35\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-34.52,~43.21]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 0.22\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .825\)</span>.
This shows that participants only used the NPV reliability information in their
allocation decisions when projects were similar, not when they were dissimilar.</p>
<p>The comparison with the no NPV condition revealed the expected pattern. For the
high alignment group, the linear NPV trend was significantly weaker in the no
NPV condition than in the high NPV reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 75.70\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([39.17,~112.24]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 4.11\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>, but not the low
NPV reliability condition, <span class="math inline">\(M = 12.24\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-27.94,~52.41]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 0.60\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .547\)</span>.
However, in the low alignment group, the linear NPV trend was significantly
weaker for the no NPV condition compared with both the low NPV reliability
condition, <span class="math inline">\(M = 64.63\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([25.76,~103.50]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 3.29\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>,
and the high NPV reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 60.29\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([24.14,~96.43]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 3.30\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>.</p>

<p>Experiment 1 found evidence for the effect of project alignment on laypeople’s
decision-making in capital allocation scenarios. Specifically, when projects
were comparable, participants used NPV when they were told that it was reliable, but
did not when they were told that it was unreliable. However, they used NPV
regardless of its reliability when it was the only shared dimension across products.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 manipulated <em>verbal</em> NPV reliability. That is, participants were
explicitly told whether NPV was considered to be a reliable metric or not.
However, in the real-world the reliability of a metric is more commonly
expressed in numerical form, such as a range around an estimate. Experiment 2
attempted to replicate the alignment effects, while manipulating the <em>numerical</em>
NPV reliability associated with each project, rather than the verbal reliability
as used in Experiment 1. Further, people with sufficient experience with
financial theory and analysis may be able to successfully draw inferences from
such information. Therefore, Experiment 2 used a sample of students enrolled in
a Master of Management degree, instead of the laypeople used in Experiment 1.</p>

</h2>
<p>Experiment 2 investigated the effects of project alignment and
numerically-expressed NPV reliability information on capital allocation
decisions. In Experiment 1, the information about NPV reliability level was
communicated explicitly (e.g., “NPV is unreliable”). However, in Experiment 2,
only the actual NPV information itself was communicated without the conclusion
about its reliability. Specifically, participants were given a range of
predicted values (akin to a confidence interval). Therefore, while Experiment 1
manipulated <em>verbal</em> NPV reliability, Experiment 2 manipulated <em>numerical</em> NPV
reliability. Further, Experiment 2 included participants with more business
experience. This experiment tested whether the previous findings of an alignment
effect would be replicated using participants with more business experience. The
experiment also tested whether this population is sensitive to variance in
forecasts.</p>
<p>Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a> was again tested to
investigate the alignment effect in the new sample. However, the other
hypotheses tested in Experiment 1 were not retested because Experiment 2
manipulated numerical reliability and did not include a no NPV condition.
Research has shown that people are poor at reasoning with numerical variance
information <span class="citation">(Batteux et al., <a href="#ref-batteux2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>; Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, <a href="#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>; Konold et al., <a href="#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>; Vivalt &amp; Coville, <a href="#ref-vivalt2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. Therefore,
Experiment 2 tested the following hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.8  (no effect of numerical reliability)  </strong></span>The NPV <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability level interaction is not significant in either
alignment condition.
</div>
<p>Experiment 2 also investigated the ability to quickly change participants’
understanding, if they did not initially use numerical NPV reliability in their
allocations. Therefore, participants were presented with a short lecture on the
importance of paying attention to variance in financial decision-making.
However, this lecture was not sufficient to inform participants’ use of
numerical reliability (see Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-3-appendix">B.2</a>). Further,
Experiment 2 investigated whether participants would be over-confident in their
understanding of NPV <span class="citation">(as in Long et al., <a href="#ref-long2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. These results are also reported in

However, this appeared to be driven by the difference between alignment

<p>Based on participants with real-world business experience, Experiment 2
replicated the alignment effect found in Experiment 1. That is, participants
relied more on NPV when faced with a set of dissimilar projects than when faced
with similar projects, supporting
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>. Experiment 2 also found
evidence for Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3">4.8</a>, with
no significant differences between the numerical reliability conditions. While
Experiment 2 did not replicate the interaction found in Experiment 1, it should
be emphasised that these are two different effects. In Experiment 1,
participants were explicitly told whether the NPV measure was reliable, while in
Experiment 2, they were provided with variance information that merely implied
NPV reliability. Thus, the results of Experiment 2 show that business students
were affected by the comparability of projects but not by numerical NPV
reliability information. Specifically, participants appeared to focus only on
the NPV itself for a specific project, not on the underlying noisiness of the
measure.</p>
<p>The participants in Experiment 2 seemed to rely on NPV more than those in
Experiment 1. This was seen by the steeper linear trends in Experiment 2. This
discrepancy may be due to the difference in domain experience and exposure to
financial metrics in formal study. However, the extra explanation and testing of
NPV for the management students may have also increased its salience. In sum,
the Experiment 2 sample showed clearer trends of NPV reliance, but importantly
was still affected by similarity even when it was manipulated within-subjects.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 tested NPV reliability expressed verbally, while Experiment 2
tested NPV reliability expressed numerically. However, the difference in
findings was confounded by the different populations that were sampled. Further,
in both experiments, the business projects consisted of a limited number of
domains. It is unclear to what extent these specific domains influenced the
results. These projects were centred around consumer products, which were chosen
to be more easily accessible to participants without business experience.
However, the individual features of a project do not necessarily indicate its
profitability. For instance, a laptop with a low storage capacity may be more
profitable than one with a high storage capacity because of consumer goods
markets. Experiment 3 addressed these limitations.</p>
<p>Another limitation of Experiments 1 and 2 was the potential confounding effect
of presentation style. The two alignment conditions differed in the number of
alignable differences, but also in the way that the information was presented.
The information in the low alignment condition was presented as paragraphs,
while the information in the high alignment condition was presented as a table.
While it is likely that these data types would be presented in this way in the
business setting, it is important to rule out that this difference did not
unnecessarily increase task difficulty. Therefore, Experiment 3 attempted to
replicate this effect while controlling for presentation style</p>

</div>

<span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Experiment 3<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alignment-8"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 3 investigated the effects of project alignment, NPV, NPV reliability
type and NPV reliability level on participants’ budget allocations. Experiment 1
manipulated NPV reliability level using verbal prompts. That is, participants
were explicitly told whether or not NPV was reliable for a certain project.
Experiment 2 investigated whether people were able to extract the same
reliability information using numerical prompts. That is, participants were
provided with NPVs with either wide or narrow ranges, indicating either low or
high reliability, respectively. Moreover, given that laypeople were sampled for
Experiment 1, and Master of Management students were sampled for Experiment 2,
it was not possible to compare the two reliability types (verbal and numerical)
without ruling out the potential confounding effect of population type. Thus,
similar to Experiments 1 and 2, Experiment 3 manipulated project alignment, NPV
and NPV reliability level but also added reliability type. Further, presentation
style was a possible confounding factor in the previous experiments. That is,
projects in the high alignment condition were always displayed in a table, while
projects in the low alignment condition were always displayed as paragraphs.
This possible confounder was excluded in Experiment 3 by using the same
presentation style for both alignment conditions.</p>
<p>In Experiment 3, the expected results for the verbal reliability condition
replicated those of Experiment 1. The numerical reliability condition may
replicate the findings of Experiment 2. However, a pilot experiment (detailed in
Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-7">B.8</a>) found no significant differences between numerical
reliability conditions. Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-8-appendix">B.3</a> shows a simulation
of the hypothesised effects, with the numerical reliability effects based on the
findings of the pilot experiment. Therefore, Experiment 3 retested
Hypotheses <a href="alignment.html#hyp:three-way-alignment-2">4.1</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2">4.3</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2">4.4</a>,
and <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2">4.5</a> for the verbal reliability
condition, but was agnostic between whether the numerical reliability condition
will look more like the pattern found in the pilot experiment or the pattern
found in Experiment 2.</p>

<p>The project displays were similar to those used in the previous experiments.

<p>Three elements were counterbalanced: (a) the association between reliability
level and project set (two variations), (b) the association between business
name and NPV (five latin square variations), and (c) project variation (five
variations per alignment condition). When counterbalancing for the high
alignment group, projects varied by project type (e.g., whether the five
projects all described oil wells or microchips). When counterbalancing for the
low alignment group, projects varied by their intrinsic features (e.g., whether
the oil well project in the set indicated a probability of finding oil of 96% or
90%). Table column order and project display order were both randomised.</p>

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV, project
alignment, NPV reliability level, and NPV reliability type on participants’
project allocations (see Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:plot-alignment-8-allocation">4.10</a> for the
main results and Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#results-alignment-8-allocation">B.3.2.1</a> for the
remainder of the hypothesised allocation effects). The four-way interaction
(alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability level <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability type)
was not significant, <span class="math inline">\(F(3.20, 1,420.19) = 0.71\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .555\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .002\)</span>. Regardless,
the primary hypotheses were supported.</p>
<div id="verbal-reliability" class="section level4" number="4.4.2.1">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.1</span> Verbal Reliability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#verbal-reliability"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The three-way interaction (alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability level <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV
amount) in the verbal reliability condition was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 13.42\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-1.27,~28.11]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 1.80\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .073\)</span>. This is
because NPV reliability level interacted with NPV in both alignment conditions.
This is a different pattern from Experiment 1 where there was no effect of NPV
reliability level in the low alignment condition. In the high alignment
condition, the interaction between the linear NPV trend and NPV reliability
level was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -36.63\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-47.02,~-26.25]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -6.93\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.
Specifically, the trend was stronger for the high reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 27.26\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([17.69,~36.83]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 5.60\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>,
compared with the low reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -9.38\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-18.86,~0.11]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -1.94\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .053\)</span>.
This shows that, similar to Experiment 1, participants’ allocations depended on
verbally expressed NPV reliability. In low alignment, there was also an
interaction between the linear NPV trend and NPV reliability level,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -23.21\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-33.60,~-12.83]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -4.39\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.
This suggests that allocations also depended on verbal reliability in the low
alignment condition.</p>
<p>However, another aspect of the data suggests a greater use of NPV in the low
alignment condition. The linear NPV trend was stronger in the low
alignment condition than in the high alignment condition when averaged over
reliability level,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 28.97\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([17.68,~40.26]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 5.04\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>. This
suggests that when NPV reliability was expressed verbally, similar to
Experiment 1, participants relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar than
when they were similar.</p>
<p>Overall, participants used NPV less when it was described as less reliable in
both high and low alignment conditions, and further, used NPV more when projects
were less alignable regardless of how reliable NPV was described to be.</p>

<p>The numerical reliability data were analysed differently to the verbal
reliability data because the effects of interest here were the alignment and
reliability level effects. The linear NPV trend was stronger in the low
alignment condition, averaged over reliability level (with Bonferroni
adjustment),
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 15.19\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.78,~29.60]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.64\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .034\)</span>. This
pattern was the same as that found for the verbal reliability condition above
and in Experiment 2. Further, the linear NPV trend was not significantly
different between the reliability level conditions for both the low alignment
condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 1.64\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-11.61,~14.90]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 0.31\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; .999\)</span>,
and high alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -1.21\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-14.46,~12.05]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -0.23\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; .999\)</span>.
This indicates that participants did not use numerical NPV reliability to inform
their allocations.</p>

<p>Similar to the verbal reliability condition, the use of NPV was stronger in the
low alignment condition than it was in the high alignment condition. However,
unlike the verbal reliability condition, allocations did not depend on numerical
reliability in either the low or the high alignment condition. In the verbal
reliability condition, allocations depended on NPV reliability level in both
alignment conditions.</p>

<p>Hypotheses <a href="alignment.html#hyp:three-way-alignment-2">4.1</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2">4.3</a>,
and <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2">4.4</a> were supported in the
verbal reliability condition. This shows that, while overall participants
preferred to use NPV as a proxy for project quality in their allocations, they
still used verbal reliability information. Specifically, when projects were
similar, participants used NPV when they were told that it was reliable, and
used alternative metrics when told that it was not reliable. However, in
Experiment 3, no support was found for
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2">4.5</a>. It was expected that
participants in the low alignment condition would use NPV regardless of the
reliability level conditions, as in Experiment 1. Rather, they used NPV less
when told that it was unreliable. However, they primarily used NPV overall, as
shown by the positive NPV trend in both reliability level conditions.</p>
<p>Further, Experiment 3 replicated the finding of Experiment 2 for the numerical
reliability condition. Specifically, participants relied more on NPV when
projects were dissimilar but, critically, did not use numerical range
information to influence their allocations. A pilot study (documented in
Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-7">B.8</a>) replicated the results of Experiment 1 in the
verbal reliability condition, but did not replicate the results of Experiment 2
in the numerical reliability condition. That is, when faced with numerical
ranges as the NPV reliability information, participants did not even use the
midpoint in their decisions. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that the
finding in the pilot experiment may have been spurious or due to an unexplored
component of the experimental design, but this can only be deteremined with
future research.</p>

</h2>
<p>Across three experiments there were two main findings: (a) NPV is used more when
options are difficult to compare in the low alignment conditions; and (b) people
do not consider numerical variance information, despite this being important to
the reliability of the NPV forecasts. This pattern with numerical reliability
information contrasted with the frequent use of verbal indicators of reliability
level. This numerical variance neglect is surprising, since other work showed
that people can readily extract variance information when experiencing numerical
sequences <span class="citation">(Rosenbaum et al., <a href="#ref-rosenbaum2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Both the verbal and numerical effects were
consistent for both naive and experienced participants, indicating their
persistence. People make use of metrics with alignable differences when required
to compare disparate options. However, they do not always use alternative
metrics, even when they are available.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 found that participants did not use NPV in their allocation
decisions when they were told that it was unreliable but did use it when told it
was reliable. Experiment 2 found that participants with some business experience
relied more on NPV for capital allocation when the rest of the information was
non-alignable compared with when it was alignable. However, they did not take
into account numerical reliability information when making these decisions.
Experiment 3 found further evidence of these effects within one experimental
design.</p>
<p>Alignable differences have been shown to be important into decision-making in
many settings <span class="citation">(Markman &amp; Loewenstein, <a href="#ref-markman2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>; Markman &amp; Medin, <a href="#ref-markman1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>. The experiments presented in this
chapter are novel in terms of the effects of project alignment on capital
allocation. Further, these experiments considered the extent to which the
reliability of an alignable measure (NPV) affects the way in which it is used.
This depended on the availability of other alignable differences in the set of
choices. If other alignable differences were available, then participants were
willing to reduce their use of a reportedly unreliable alignable measure (or use
it when told that it was reliable). However, when no other alignable differences
were available, then the alignable, albeit unreliable, measure was more likely
to be used. This was found in both Experiments 1 and 3, as well as in a pilot
study to a lesser extent (reported in Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-1">B.4</a>).</p>
<p>Financial measures such as NPV are useful because of their alignability. That
is, they may serve as an alignable difference, regardless of the inherent
similarities between a set of projects. Psychologically, these measures are
useful because they allow for relevant inferences <span class="citation">(Lassaline, <a href="#ref-lassaline1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span> and because
they offer an abstraction of concrete details <span class="citation">(Doumas &amp; Hummel, <a href="#ref-doumas2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. However, the
structural alignment account does not directly speak to real-world implications
when there is a need for non-alignable comparisons. NPV is a type of abstraction
that facilitates the comparison of different aspects of a company. For instance,
the use of NPV may facilitate the comparison of an oil field project with a
refinery project. However, this increased alignment could actually hide
important information because it does not consider the finer complexities
inherent in each business unit. The forecasts used to calculate NPV for each
business unit are based on different indicators, and there are likely to be
differences between each unit’s estimates. Thus, one can imagine a continuum of
comparisons in which the usefulness of comparison increases with the level of
alignability but depends on the level of abstraction that is required to achieve
the alignment.</p>
<p>The finding that participants, even those with some business experience, did not
sufficiently consider variance information is surprising but understandable. It
is surprising because financial decision-making largely depends on the
consideration of different sources of variance (e.g., risk, volatility, and
uncertainty). At the same time, it is understandable because research from
psychology and statistics education shows that statistics students and people in
general have a poor ability to draw statistical inferences <span class="citation">(e.g., Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, <a href="#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>; Konold et al., <a href="#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>. Future research should investigate the conditions under which
individuals’ sensitivity to variance information may be facilitated. For
instance, it is unclear whether it is merely salience that is lacking, meaning
that visual aids could be useful, or whether a further explicit explanation of
statistical inference is necessary. The findings of a pilot experiment suggest
that participants struggle to use numerical NPV reliability information, even
when given explicit instructions (see Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-6">B.7</a>).</p>
<p>A possible limitation of these experiments is the use of NPV as the only
financial metric. In the business world, there are many metrics that serve
similar functions and are used as tools to deal with non-alignable options.
Therefore, future research should attempt to replicate the current findings
using different financial measures.</p>
<p>Future research should also investigate the boundary conditions of the
reliability type effect. That is, people appear to respond to explicit
reliability information but not to variance information that only implies
reliability. Future research should attempt to identify the minimal variance
information that participants need to understand the relevant implications for
reliability. Participants may simply not notice the variance information or
assume that it is irrelevant. For instance, future research could test
participants in a condition in which the variance information is more salient.</p>
