<p>One of the most important tasks that executives face is allocating resources
within their company. This requires ranking different projects based on their
importance and predicted success, and allocating limited resources respectively
(not unlike a scientific funding agency). Ranking projects requires comparing
them across a number of component dimensions. For example, an executive in an
oil company might have multiple proposals on his or her desk for where to
explore for oil next, and how to do so. Figuring out what makes one oil
discovery project better than another one is relatively easy. However, consider
a different scenario in which the executive has to allocate resources between an
oil discovery project and an oil refinery project. The dimensions of an oil
refinery project that distinguishes good from bad projects may be totally
different from the dimensions of oil discovery projects that do the same. Think
of a funding agency giving out fellowships, and deciding between two cognitive
scientists, or a cognitive scientist and a physicist. What makes a physics
proposal better for the field of physics than a cognitive science proposal is
for cognitive science?</p>
<p>Structure-mapping theory <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner, 1983</a>; SMT; <a href="references.html#ref-gentner1997" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner &amp; Markman, 1997</a>)</span> provides a model of
comparison that psychologically distinguishes these two kinds of allocation
tasks. SMT models comparison as a process of bringing conceptual structures into
alignment, which when possible, puts shared component dimensions into
correspondence. Alignment both highlights when two conceptual structures share
dimensions, but also highlights how the two structures differ along those shared
dimensions, called <em>alignable differences</em>. For example, when comparing two oil
discovery projects, all the relevant processes of planning an exploration and
measuring the amount of hydrocarbons in a prospect might be identical, but the
specific amount measured will be different. This is the alignable difference: a
difference between the two projects that is constrained within the same
conceptual structure. However, when comparing between an oil field and a
refinery, there will be significantly more <em>non-alignable differences</em>, because
the two domains do not share component dimensions. That is, many of the
processes that exist in the exploration business unit have a significantly
different dimensional structure to those in the refinery business unit, such
that it will be difficult to find meaningful alignments. More non-alignable
differences mean that there are less opportunities to make meaningful
comparisons, and so would make predicting project success and ranking their
priority more difficult. In this chapter, I experimentally examined project
comparisons, and how that affects resource allocation decisions. My working
hypothesis was that comparisons with more alignable differences will make
project predictions more precise, and project rankings easier and more
informative, than a comparison with non-alignable differences.</p>
<p>However, what happens when the two domains are too disparate for a
decision-maker to align them, but the task demands that they be aligned? This is
actually a bit of uncharted territory experimentally. The prediction is that
when forced to, people will grab at any piece of information that they can and
then try to infer and abstract as much as seems reasonable to ease the
alignment. This is in fact what occurs very frequently in business settings.
Corporate enterprises continue to embrace diversification strategies in their
investments, and so constantly have to make resource allocation choices that
involve very disparate domains. To overcome these difficult comparisons
executives rely on various financial measures that in theory can apply to any
project or business proposal. These financial measures work well to ease the
burden of the difficult comparison by abstracting away from the complexities of
the individual projects, and just focus on financial information such as total
costs, projected profits, etc. Initially hard-to-compare projects can therefore
be more easily evaluated by comparing values on individual numerical measures.</p>
<p>The most common financial measure that is used by executives in order to value
projects is Net Present Value <span class="citation">(NPV; <a href="references.html#ref-graham2001" role="doc-biblioref">Graham &amp; Harvey, 2001</a>)</span>. NPV is the difference between
the money that a project is forecasted to make and the initial investment in its
development (accounting for the time value of money), as seen in
Equation <a href="introduction.html#eq:npv">(1.1)</a>.</p>
<p>NPV is commonly used to decide about resource allocation and investment. The
simple rule is that if a project’s NPV is positive, then it is financially
viable, and if NPV is negative, then it is not. However, the use of NPV has been
criticised, both by academics and practitioners <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-fox2008" role="doc-biblioref">Fox, 2008</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-willigers2017" role="doc-biblioref">Willigers et al., 2017</a>)</span>. The
main criticism is that there is a lot of underlying variance within the NPV
measure that is not made apparent by the final form of the measure: a single
numerical value. For instance, NPV is dependent on the cash inflows that are
projected for each year of the project. However, financial forecasting is known
to often be inaccurate and prone to optimism bias <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2003" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo &amp; Kahneman, 2003</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-puri2007" role="doc-biblioref">Puri &amp; Robinson, 2007</a>)</span>.
Therefore, there is bound to be variation in the reliability of NPV measures as
a function of the forecasting error in the cash flow calculations. The duration
of the project and the discount rate are further sources of variance that are
hidden by the single numerical value of NPV.</p>
<p>As such, the secondary goal of this research was to investigate the extent to
which people are sensitive to variance information (from financial forecasting)
when making resource allocation decisions. This consideration is especially
important in the resource allocation situations illustrated above, in which
executives need to compare between projects from disparate domains and therefore
have to rely on NPV. This matters because the NPV calculated from different
domains may have different underlying forecasting error, which may compromise
the utility of using NPV as the basis of the comparison. Do executives
sufficiently account for the inherent variance in the measure that they rely on
so much? Research showed that people are good at extracting variance information
from numerical sequences <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rosenbaum2020" role="doc-biblioref">Rosenbaum et al., 2020</a>)</span>. However, people struggle to use
variance information when it is represented numerically <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-batteux2020" role="doc-biblioref">Batteux et al., 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">Konold et al., 1993</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-vivalt2018" role="doc-biblioref">Vivalt &amp; Coville, 2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>In <a href="alignment.html#alignment-2">Experiment 1</a> I investigated the effect of alignment on the
decision-making of naive participants’ resource allocation to a set of fictional
projects. I manipulated NPV reliability by directly stating whether it is a
reliable measure because I did not assume the naive participants would have the
requisite knowledge to be sensitive to reliability information otherwise. I
predicted that when projects are alignable, participants use NPV if they are
told that it is a reliable measure, but do not use it if they are told that it
is not reliable. However, when projects are not comparable, I predicted that
participants will use NPV regardless of how reliable they are told NPV is.</p>
<p>In <a href="alignment.html#alignment-3">Experiment 2</a>, I investigated the decision-making of
management students in almost the same situation as Experiment 1. The main
difference was that instead of telling participants the reliability of NPV, I
manipulated the level of <em>numerical</em> reliability that is associated with it.
That is, the width of numerical ranges around an NPV. I predicted that
participants will rely more on NPV in the non-alignable projects than in the
alignable projects. However, I predicted there will be no effect of numerical
reliability, since there is very little evidence that people are sensitive to
variance information when represented numerically.</p>
<p>In <a href="#alignment-8">Experiment 3</a> I again tested the alignment and reliability
effects in a non-business population, but manipulated both verbal and numerical
reliability in the same experiment to allow for direct comparisons. I predicted
an effect of reliability in the verbal reliability condition, but not in the
numerical reliability condition. Further, I used project descriptions with
clearer profitability indicators, and added a larger selection of business
industries.</p>

</h2>
<p>Experiment 1 investigated the effects of alignment and explicit NPV reliability
information on financial resource allocation decisions. The structural alignment
literature suggests that people weigh alignable differences more heavily than
non-alignable differences. I expected that people would use NPV more than any
other product attributes (because it applied to every product). However, I
expected this effect to vary with how reliable participants thought the value
was. That is, if other project dimensions were alignable, then it should be
easier to adjust the use of NPV based on its reliability. However, I predicted
that in a low alignment condition there will be a reliance on NPV, as the sole
alignable difference, regardless of its stated reliability. I used a no NPV
condition in order to get a better understanding of the baseline responding to
the materials without NPV. To measure these effects I considered the linear
trend of how NPV across projects relates to the money allocated to the projects.
Critically, participants saw both NPV and other features intrinsic to each
project domain, and these were inversely related. Therefore, a positive NPV
amount trend indicates a reliance on NPV, whereas a negative trend indicates a
reliance on the intrinsic project features. Specifically, I tested the following
hypothesises:</p>

<p>The instructions page explained to the participants, who did not necessarily
have business experience, about the task and NPV. However, I also used this page
to manipulate whether they were told that NPV was reliable or unreliable as a
financial measure. Participants in the low NPV reliability condition were told
that NPV is an unreliable metric, whereas those in the high NPV reliability
condition were told that NPV is a reliable metric. Those in the no NPV condition
saw instructions that did not include the NPV explanation. Critically,
participants were told to invest in products with a high objective value
(because a better quality product is not always better in a consumer goods
market). Since this might still not use this instruction when directly viewing
the projects, Experiment 3 used projects with attributes that more inherently
conveyed quality. Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#instructions-materials-alignment-2-appendix">B.1.1.1.1</a>

<p>Participants read sets of fictional business projects to potentially allocate
resources to. The high alignment display was a table that listed various
attributes for five projects (see
Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:projects-alignment-high-materials-alignment-2">4.2</a>). The low
alignment display had each project expressed as individual paragraphs that
described the relevant attributes through full sentences (see
Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:projects-alignment-low-materials-alignment-2">4.1</a>). For the high
alignment display, the product was the same, and the concrete attributes were
consistent, while in the low alignment display, each project was a different
product with concrete attributes relevant to that project. For both alignment
conditions each project description included an NPV.</p>
<p>This alignment manipulation was reinforced by visual presentation. The table
format is better afforded by the high alignment condition because all the
dimensions are shared. However, this confounds alignment with presentation
style. I address this in <a href="#alignment-8">Experiment 3</a> by equating the table
format across both alignment conditions.</p>

<p>Critically, the value of the concrete attributes were always in conflict with
the NPV. For instance, Project 4 always had the lowest value for each of the
concrete attributes for laptops, but always had the highest NPV. This was done
in order to be able to use participants’ allocations as a proxy measure for an
individual’s degree of dependence on NPV.</p>

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment

effect seems to be driven by the differences between the no NPV condition and

<p>Experiment 1 found evidence for the effect of alignment on laypeople’s
decision-making in resource allocation scenarios. Specifically, I found that
when projects are comparable, people use NPV when they are told it is reliable,
but not when they are told it is unreliable. However, they use NPV regardless of
reliability when it is the only shared dimension across products.</p>
<p>In Experiment 1 I manipulated <em>verbal</em> NPV reliability. That is, participants
were explicitly told whether NPV is considered to be a reliable metric or not.
However, in the real-world the reliability of a metric is more commonly
expressed in numerical form, such as a range around and estimate. In Experiment
2 I will attempt to replicate the alignment effects, but while manipulating the
numerical reliability associated with each project, rather than the verbal
reliability as I have previously used. Further, it might be the case that only
those with sufficient experience with financial theory and analysis will be able
to successfully draw inferences from such information. Therefore, in Experiment
2 I used a sample of Masters of Management students, instead of the laypeople in
Experiment 1.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Experiment 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alignment-3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 2 further investigated the effects of alignment and
numerically-expressed variance information on financial resource allocation
decisions. In <a href="alignment.html#alignment-2">Experiment 1</a> the information about the variance
inherent in the NPVs was communicated explicitly as the conclusion, e.g., NPV is
unreliable. In Experiment 2 however, only the actual variance information itself
was communicated without the conclusion about its reliability. Here, I simply
communicated variance by showing the range of predicted values (akin to a
confidence interval). Therefore, while previously I manipulated <em>verbal</em>
reliability, in Experiment 2 I manipulated <em>numerical</em> reliability. Further, in
this experiment, I studied participants with more business experience than the
previously used laypeople samples. The main two interests in this experiment
were first, whether the previous findings of an alignment effect will replicate
with people with more business experience; and second, whether this population
is sensitive to variance in forecasts. As well as again testing
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>, I tested the following
hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.8  </strong></span>The NPV amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount interaction will not be significant
in either alignment condition.
</div>
<p>I was also interested in the potential to quickly change participants’
understanding, if they did not initially use numerical reliability for their
allocations. Therefore, I presented participants with a short lecture on the
importance of paying attention variance in financial decision-making. However,
results were inconclusive, so see but see

the addition of another set of projects that differed in semantic content. That
is, the projects were about different types of projects (to allow for a
within-subjects manipulation). Along with the single NPV, the forecasted ranges
of cash flow that the NPV was calculated from were presented. In the low
numerical reliability condition, the ranges were <span class="math inline">\(\pm85\)</span>% around the mean (e.g.,
$150-$1850, where the forecast mean is $1000); whereas in the high numerical
reliability condition, the ranges were <span class="math inline">\(\pm5\)</span>% around the mean (e.g.,

reliability in the measure, while narrow ranges should indicate high

<p>Experiment 2 replicated the alignment effect found in Experiment 1 with
participants with real-world business experience. I found evidence for
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>, as people seemed to rely
more on NPV when faced with a set of dissimilar project than when projects were
all from the same domain. Further, I found evidence for
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3">4.8</a>, with no
significant differences between the numerical reliability amount conditions.
While I did not replicate the interaction found in Experiment 1, it should be
emphasised that these are two different effects. In Experiment 1, I explicitly
told participants about the reliability of the NPV measure, whereas in
Experiment 2, I provided them with variance information that merely implies NPV
reliability. Thus, I showed that business students are affected by comparability
of project sets, but not by numerical NPV reliability information. Specifically,
participants appeared to only focus on the NPV itself, and not on any variations
in the underlying noisiness of the measure for a specific project.</p>
<p>However, it is unclear whether laypeople would also display this variance
neglect. Further, in Experiments 1 and 2, the business projects consisted of
a limited number of domains. It is unclear to what extent these specific domains
influenced the results. These projects were centred around consumer products,
with various features displayed. Consumer projects were chosen to be more easily
accessible to participants without business experience. However, with these
projects, individual features do not necessarily indicate a project’s
profitability. For instance, a laptop with a low capacity can be more profitable
than a laptop with a high capacity due to the existence of consumer goods
markets. In Experiment 3, I addressed these limitations.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the last two experiments was the potential presentation
style confound. The two alignment conditions differed in the number of alignable
differences, but also in the way that the information was presented. The
information in the low alignment condition was presented in paragraphs, whereas
the information in the high alignment condition was presented in tables. While
it is likely that each of these data types would be presented in this way in a
business setting, it is important to rule out that this manipulation did not
also unnecessarily increase task difficulty. Therefore, Experiment 3 attempted
to replicate this effect, while controlling for presentation style.</p>

<p>Experiment 3 investigated the effects of alignment, reliability type, NPV
amount, and reliability amount on allocations. Experiment 1 manipulated
reliability amount by using <em>verbal</em> prompts. That is, participants were told
explicitly whether or not NPV was reliable for a certain project industry.
Experiment 2 investigated whether people were able to extract this same kind of
reliability information from <em>numerical</em> prompts. That is, participants saw NPVs
with either wide or narrow ranges, indicating either low or high reliability of
the metric, respectively. However, Experiment 1 sampled laypeople, whereas
Experiment 2 sampled a Masters of Management course. Therefore, I was not able
to compare the two reliability types (verbal and numerical) without ruling out
the potential confound of population type. As such, in Experiment 3 I
manipulated NPV amount, alignment, and reliability amount, but also added a
reliability type factor. Further, presentation style was a possible confound in
the alignment manipulation of the previous experiments. That is, the business
projects in the high alignment condition were always displayed as a part of a
table, whereas the projects in the low alignment condition were displayed in
prose, as paragraphs. Experiment 3 fixed this by using the same presentation
style across alignment condition.</p>
<p>As well as again testing

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV amount,
alignment, NPV reliability amount, and NPV reliability type on participants’
project allocations. Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:plot-alignment-8-allocation">4.10</a> shows these
data. Only the main results are reported here, while the rest of the
hypothesised allocation effects are reported in
Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#results-alignment-8-allocation">B.3.2.1</a>.</p>
<p>The four-way interaction (alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV
amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability type) was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(3.20, 1,420.19) = 0.71\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .555\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .002\)</span>. Further, the three-way interaction
(alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV amount) in the verbal
reliability condition was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 13.42\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-1.27,~28.11]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 1.80\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .073\)</span>. This is
most likely due to the size of the two-way interactions in each alignment
condition being relatively similar, despite the expectation of no interaction in
the low alignment condition (as was seen in <a href="#results-alignment-2">Experiment
1</a>). In high alignment, this interaction (between the
linear NPV amount trend and NPV reliability amount) was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -36.63\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-47.02,~-26.25]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -6.93\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.
Specifically, the trend was stronger in the high reliability amount condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 27.26\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([17.69,~36.83]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 5.60\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>,
than in the low reliability amount condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -9.38\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-18.86,~0.11]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -1.94\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .053\)</span>.
The same interaction was significant in the low alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -23.21\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-33.60,~-12.83]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -4.39\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.
Despite the lack of a three-way interaction in the verbal reliability condition
(indicating a difference in the two alignment two-way interactions), the linear
NPV amount trend was stronger in the low alignment condition than in the high
alignment condition when averaging over reliability amount,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 28.97\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([17.68,~40.26]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 5.04\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the numerical reliability condition, the linear NPV amount trend was not
significantly “equivalent” between those in the low and high alignment
conditions (averaging over reliability amount),
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 15.19\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([3.90,~26.48]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.64\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .996\)</span>. In
fact, a post-hoc comparison suggests that the low alignment trend was stronger
(with Bonferroni adjustment),
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 15.19\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.78,~29.60]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.64\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .034\)</span>. Further,
the difference between the linear NPV trend was not significantly different
between reliability amount conditions in both the low alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 1.64\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-11.61,~14.90]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 0.31\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; .999\)</span>,
and high alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -1.21\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-14.46,~12.05]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -0.23\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; .999\)</span>.
This replicates the finding from <a href="results-alignment-3">Experiment 2</a> that NPV is
used more in low alignment, but numerical reliability is ignored.</p>

<p>Hypotheses <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2">4.3</a>,
and <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2">4.4</a> were supported. This shows
that while overall participants prefer to use NPV as a proxy for project quality
in their allocations, they still use verbal reliability information.
Specifically, when projects are similar, people use NPV when they are told that
it is reliable, and use alternative metrics when told that it is not reliable.
However, Experiment 3 did not find evidence for
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2">4.5</a>. Instead, I found
that even in the low alignment condition, participants were still able to use
NPV more when told that it was reliable.</p>
<p>Further, I did not find support for Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:four-way-alignment-8">4.9</a>.
The hypothesis was constructed in response to the results of a pilot study
(documented in Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-7">B.8</a>) that replicated the results of
Experiment 1 in the verbal reliability condition, but did not replicate the
results of Experiment 2 in the numerical reliability condition. That is, I found
that when faced with numerical ranges as variance information, people did not
seem to even use the midpoint in their decisions. In Experiment 3, on the other
hand, I replicated the finding of Experiment 2 in the numerical reliability
condition. Specifically, I found that people used NPV more when projects were
dissimilar, but critically, that they did not use numerical range information to
moderate their allocations.</p>

</h2>
<p>Across three experiments there were two main findings: 1. NPV is used more when
options are hard to compare; and 2. people do not consider numerical variance
information, despite this being important to the reliability of the NPV
forecasts. I found these effects consistently across both naive and experienced
populations, which indicates their persistence. When finding themselves in a
situation that requires comparison across disparate options, people make use of
metrics with alignable differences. However, they do not sufficiently moderate
their use of such metrics even when they have alternative attributes to use.</p>
<p>In Experiment 1, I found that when participants were told that NPV was
unreliable, they did not use it in their allocation decisions, but when they
were told that it was reliable they did. In Experiment 2, I found that people
with some business experience relied on NPV more for resource allocation when
the rest of the information was non-alignable, compared to when it was
alignable. However, participants did not take into account the <em>numerical</em>
reliability information when making these decisions. In Experiment 3, I found
further evidence of these effects, within one experimental design.</p>
<p>Alignable differences have been shown to be important to decision making in many
settings <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-markman2010" role="doc-biblioref">Arthur B. Markman &amp; Loewenstein, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-markman1995" role="doc-biblioref">Arthur B. Markman &amp; Medin, 1995</a>)</span>. The experiments in this chapter are novel
in the investigation of alignment effects in a resource allocation paradigm.
Further, I considered the extent to which the reliability of an alignable
measure (NPV) affects its use in choice. I found that this is dependent on the
availability of other alignable differences in the choice set. If other
alignable differences are available, then participants are willing to reduce
their use of a supposedly unreliable alignable measure (and use it when told
that it is reliable). However, when no other alignable differences are
available, then the unreliable, but alignable, measure is used less. I found
this result in Experiment 1 and 3, as well as a pilot study (although the
alignment effects appeared weaker perhaps due to interference due to a
within-subjects manipulation; see Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-1">B.4</a>).</p>
<p>Financial measure such as NPV are useful because of their alignability. That is,
they act as an alignable difference regardless of the inherent similarity of a
set of projects. Psychologically, these measures are useful because they allow
for relevant inferences <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lassaline1996" role="doc-biblioref">Lassaline, 1996</a>)</span>, and because they offer an abstraction
of concrete details <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-doumas2013" role="doc-biblioref">Doumas &amp; Hummel, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the theoretical account of structural alignment does not directly speak
to the real-world implications when there is a need for non-alignable
comparisons. NPV is a type of abstraction that allows comparison between
different aspects of a company. For instance, comparing an oil field project
with a refinery project might be made easier by using NPV. On the other hand,
this increased alignment might actually hide important information because it
does not consider the finer complexities inherent within each business unit. The
forecasts that are the basis of NPV are based on different indicators for each
unit, there are differences in variance between the estimates from each unit,
etc. As such, one can imagine a continuum of similarity comparisons in which
usefulness of comparison increases with the level of alignability, but is
moderated by the level of abstraction that is required to make the alignment.</p>
<p>The finding that people, even with some business experience, do not sufficiently
consider variance information is surprising, but understandable. It is
surprising because so much of financial decision making depends on considering
different sources of variance, e.g., risk, volatility, and uncertainty. However,
it is understandable because research from psychology and statistics education
shows that statistics students and people in general have a poor ability to make
statistical inferences <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">Konold et al., 1993</a>)</span>. Future research should
investigate the conditions under which people’s sensitivity to variance
information can be facilitated. For instance, it is unclear whether it is merely
salience that is lacking, and that therefore visual aids could be useful, or
whether further explicit explanation of the statistical inference is necessary.
Pilot experiments suggest that participants still struggle to use numerical
reliability information, even when given very explicit instructions (see
Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-6">B.7</a>).</p>
<p>A possible limitation of these experiments was the use of NPV as the only
financial metric. In the business world there are many metrics that serve
similar functions and I predict would be used as a tool to deal with
non-alignable options, as NPV was in the current study. Therefore, future
research should attempt to replicate the current findings with different
financial measures.</p>
<p>Future research should also investigate the boundary conditions of the
reliability effect. That is, people seem to be responding to explicit
reliability information, but not to variance information that implies
reliability. As such, it would be interesting to find out what is the minimal
kind of information about variance that participants need in order to understand
the relevant implications about reliability. It may be the case that
participants simply do not notice the variability information, or that they find
it irrelevant. For instance, future research could test participants in a
condition in which the variability information is more salient.</p>
