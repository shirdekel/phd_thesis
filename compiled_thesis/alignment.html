<p>One of the most important tasks that executives face is allocating resources
within their company. This requires ranking different projects based on their
importance and predicted success, and allocating limited resources respectively
(not unlike a scientific funding agency). Ranking projects requires comparing
them across a number of dimensions. For example, an executive in an oil company
might have multiple proposals on his or her desk for where to explore for oil
next and how to do so. Figuring out what makes one oil discovery project better
than another one is relatively easy. However, consider a different scenario in
which the executive has to allocate resources between an oil discovery project
and an oil refinery project. The dimensions of an oil refinery project that
distinguishes good from bad projects may be totally different from the
dimensions of oil discovery projects that do the same. Think of a funding agency
giving out fellowships and deciding between two cognitive scientists, or a
cognitive scientist and a physicist. What makes a physics proposal better for
the field of physics than a cognitive science proposal is for cognitive science?</p>
<p>Structure-mapping theory <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner, 1983</a>; SMT; <a href="references.html#ref-gentner1997" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner &amp; Markman, 1997</a>)</span> provides a model of
comparison that psychologically distinguishes these two kinds of allocation
tasks. SMT models comparison as a process of bringing conceptual structures into
alignment which, when possible, puts shared component dimensions into
correspondence. Alignment both highlights when two conceptual structures share
dimensions, and also highlights how the two structures differ along those shared
dimensions, called <em>alignable differences</em>. For example, when comparing two oil
discovery projects, all the relevant processes of planning an exploration and
measuring the amount of hydrocarbons in a prospect might be identical, but the
specific amount measured will be different. This is the alignable difference: a
difference between the two projects that is constrained within the same
conceptual structure. However, when comparing between an oil field and a
refinery, there will be significantly more <em>non-alignable differences</em>, because
the two domains do not share component dimensions. That is, many of the
processes that exist in the exploration business unit have a significantly
different dimensional structure to those in the refinery business unit, such
that it will be difficult to find meaningful alignments. More non-alignable
differences mean that there are less opportunities to make meaningful
comparisons, and so would make predicting project success and ranking their
priority more difficult. This chapter experimentally examined project
comparisons and how such comparisons affect resource allocation decisions. The
working hypothesis was that comparisons with more alignable differences will
make project predictions more precise, and project rankings easier and more
informative, than a comparison with non-alignable differences.</p>
<p>However, what happens when the two domains are too disparate for a
decision-maker to align them, but the task demands that they be aligned? This is
actually a bit of uncharted territory experimentally. The prediction is that
when forced to, people will grab at any piece of information that they can and
then try to infer and abstract as much as seems reasonable to ease the
alignment. This is in fact what occurs very frequently in business settings.
Corporate enterprises continue to embrace diversification strategies in their
investments, and so constantly have to make resource allocation choices that
involve very disparate domains. To overcome these difficult comparisons,
executives rely on various financial measures that in theory can apply to any
project or business proposal. These financial measures work well to ease the
burden of the difficult comparison by abstracting away from the complexities of
the individual projects, and just focus on financial information such as total
costs, projected profits, etc. Initially hard-to-compare projects can therefore
be more easily evaluated by comparing values on individual numerical measures.</p>
<p>The most common financial measure that is used by executives in order to value
business project proposals is Net Present Value <span class="citation">(NPV; <a href="references.html#ref-graham2001" role="doc-biblioref">Graham &amp; Harvey, 2001</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-remer1993" role="doc-biblioref">Remer et al., 1993</a>)</span>.
NPV is the difference between the money that a project is forecasted to make and
the initial investment in its development (accounting for the time value of
money), as seen in Equation <a href="introduction.html#eq:npv">(1.1)</a>.</p>
<p>NPV is commonly used to decide about resource allocation and investment. The
simple rule is that if a project’s NPV is positive, then it is financially
viable, and if NPV is negative, then it is not. However, the use of NPV has been
criticised, both by academics and practitioners <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-fox2008" role="doc-biblioref">Fox, 2008</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-willigers2017" role="doc-biblioref">Willigers et al., 2017</a>)</span>. The
main criticism is that there is underlying variance within the NPV measure that
is not made apparent by the final form of the measure, a single numerical value.
For instance, NPV is dependent on the cash inflows that are projected for each
year of the project. However, financial forecasting is known to often be
inaccurate and prone to optimism bias <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2003" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo &amp; Kahneman, 2003</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-puri2007" role="doc-biblioref">Puri &amp; Robinson, 2007</a>)</span>. Therefore,
there is bound to be variation in the reliability of NPV measures as a function
of the forecasting error in the cash flow calculations. The duration of the
project and the discount rate are further sources of variance that are hidden by
the single numerical value of NPV.</p>
<p>As such, the secondary goal of this research was to investigate the extent to
which people are sensitive to variance information (from financial forecasting)
when making resource allocation decisions. This consideration is especially
important in the resource allocation situations illustrated above, in which
executives need to compare between projects from disparate domains and therefore
have to rely on NPV. This matters because the NPV calculated from different
domains may have different underlying forecasting error, which may compromise
the utility of using NPV as the basis of the comparison. Do executives
sufficiently account for the inherent variance in the measure that they rely on
so much? Research shows that people are good at extracting variance information
when experiencing numerical sequences <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rosenbaum2020" role="doc-biblioref">Rosenbaum et al., 2020</a>)</span>. However, people struggle
to use variance information when it is represented numerically <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-batteux2020" role="doc-biblioref">Batteux et al., 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">Konold et al., 1993</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-vivalt2021" role="doc-biblioref">Vivalt &amp; Coville, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Experiment <a href="alignment.html#alignment-2">1</a> investigated the effect of alignment on the
decision-making of naive participants’ resource allocation to a set of fictional
projects. NPV reliability was manipulated by directly stating whether it is a
reliable measure because the naive participants were assumed not to have the
requisite knowledge to be sensitive to reliability information otherwise. This
experiment predicted that when projects are alignable, participants use NPV if
they are told that it is a reliable measure, but do not use it if they are told
that it is unreliable. However, when projects are not alignable, participants
were predicted to use NPV regardless of how reliable they are told NPV is.</p>
<p>Experiment <a href="alignment.html#alignment-3">2</a>, investigated the decision-making of management
students in almost the same situation as Experiment <a href="alignment.html#alignment-2">1</a>. The main
difference was that instead of telling participants the reliability of NPV, this
experiment manipulated the level of associated <em>numerical</em> NPV reliability. That
is, the width of numerical ranges around an NPV. Participants were predicted to
rely more on NPV in the non-alignable projects than in the alignable projects.
However, this experiment predicted that there will be no effect of numerical
reliability, since there is very little evidence that people are sensitive to
variance information when represented numerically.</p>
<p>Experiment <a href="alignment.html#alignment-8">3</a> again tested the alignment and reliability effects
in a non-business population, but manipulated both verbal and numerical
reliability in the same experiment to allow for direct comparisons. An effect of
reliability was predicted in the verbal reliability condition, but not in the
numerical reliability condition. Further, this experiment used project
descriptions with clearer profitability indicators, and added a larger selection
of business industries.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Experiment 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alignment-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 1 investigated the effects of alignment and explicit NPV reliability
information on financial resource allocation decisions. The structural alignment
literature suggests that people weigh alignable differences more heavily than
non-alignable differences. It was expected that people would use NPV more than
any other product attributes (because it applied to every product). However,
this effect should vary with participants’ perceived reliability of the value.
That is, if other project dimensions were alignable, then it should be easier to
adjust the use of NPV based on its reliability. However, it was predicted that
in a low alignment there will be a reliance on NPV, as the sole
alignable difference, regardless of its stated reliability. These effects were
measured by considering the linear trend of how NPV, across projects, relates to
the money allocated to the projects. Critically, participants saw both NPV and
other features intrinsic to each project domain, and these were inversely
related. Therefore, a positive NPV amount trend indicated a reliance on NPV,
whereas a negative trend indicated a reliance on the intrinsic project features.
First, Experiment 1 tested the following omnibus hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:three-way-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.1  (Overall effect)  </strong></span>The alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV amount interaction will
be significant.
</div>
<p>Initially, the specific effects were tested excluding the no NPV condition.
Comparing across dissimilar projects will be difficult, so participants are
expected to rely on NPV more in such a scenario than when they have other
alignable attributes. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.2  (Alignment effect)  </strong></span>The linear NPV amount trend will be higher, on average, in low alignment
condition compared to high alignment.
</div>
<p>Participants are likely to moderate their allocations based on the provided
reliability information. However, it is more likely that they will do this when
they have multiple options for metrics to use than when only NPV is
alignable. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.3  (Moderation of NPV reliability by alignment)  </strong></span>The NPV amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability interaction will be stronger in the high
alignment than in low alignment.
</div>
<p>More specifically, it is expected that when projects are similar, participants
will rely on NPV more (positive NPV amount trend) when they are told that it is
reliable and rely more on the projects’ intrinsic features (negative NPV amount
trend) when they are told that it is unreliable. However, when projects are
dissimilar, it is expected that participants will rely solely on NPV solely,
regardless of what they are told about its reliability. Therefore, Experiment 1
tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.4  (NPV reliability in high alignment)  </strong></span>In high alignment, the linear NPV amount trend will be higher in
the high reliability condition than in the low reliability condition
</div>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.5  (NPV reliability in low alignment)  </strong></span>In low alignment, the linear NPV amount trend will not differ
significantly between reliability conditions
</div>
<p>A no NPV condition was used to gain a better understanding of the baseline
responding to the materials without NPV. This was used to determine the extent
of participants’ reliance on NPV. When projects were similar, this condition was
expected to be equivalent to the low reliability condition, as participants
disregard NPV. When projects were dissimilar, this condition was expected to
express the average participant value judgements for the project descriptions,
which should result in a more or less flat NPV amount trend. Therefore,
Experiment 1 tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-high-no-NPV-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.6  (No NPV comparison in high alignment)  </strong></span>In high alignment, the linear NPV amount trend will be higher in the high
reliability condition than the no NPV reliability condition.
</div>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-alignment-low-no-NPV-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.7  (No NPV comparison in low alignment)  </strong></span>In low alignment, the linear NPV amount trend in both the low and high
reliability conditions will be higher than the no NPV reliability condition.

<p>The instructions page explained to the participants, who did not necessarily
have business experience, about the task and NPV. However, this page was also
used to manipulate whether participants were told that NPV was reliable or
unreliable as a financial measure. Participants in the low NPV reliability
condition were told that NPV is an unreliable metric, whereas those in the high
NPV reliability condition were told that NPV is a reliable metric. Those in the
no NPV condition saw instructions that did not include the NPV explanation.
Critically, participants were told to invest in products with a high objective
value (because a better quality product is not always better in a consumer goods
market). Since participants might still not use this instruction when directly
viewing the projects, Experiment 3 used projects with attributes that more
inherently conveyed quality.

<p>Participants read sets of fictional business projects for which to potentially
allocate resources. The high alignment display was a table that listed various
attributes for five projects (see
Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:projects-alignment-high-materials-alignment-2">4.1</a>). The low
alignment display had each project expressed as individual paragraphs that
described the relevant attributes through full sentences (see
Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:projects-alignment-low-materials-alignment-2">4.2</a>). For the high
alignment display, the product was the same, and the concrete attributes were
consistent, while in the low alignment display, each project was a different
product with concrete attributes relevant to that project. For both alignment
conditions each project description included an NPV.</p>
<p>This alignment manipulation was reinforced by visual presentation. The table
format is better afforded by the high alignment condition because all the
dimensions are shared. However, this confounds alignment with presentation
style. This is addressed in Experiment 3 by equating the table format across
both alignment conditions.</p>

<p>Critically, the value of the concrete attributes were always in conflict with
the NPV. For instance, Project 4 always had the lowest value for each of the
concrete attributes for laptops, but always had the highest NPV. This meant that

Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:plot-alignment-2-allocation">4.4</a>, the alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>
reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV amount interaction was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(6.57, 367.76) = 2.18\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .039\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .038\)</span>. The
analyses excluding the no NPV condition showed the expected results. The NPV
amount trend was higher in the low alignment condition than in the high
alignment condition, <span class="math inline">\(M = 61.70\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([33.02,~90.37]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(76) = 4.29\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>,
averaging over reliability amount. This shows that people relied on NPV more
when projects were dissimilar than when they were similar.</p>
<p>Further, the NPV amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount interaction was
stronger in the high alignment condition than in the low alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 67.81\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([10.47,~125.16]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(76) = 2.36\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .021\)</span>. Specifically, in
high alignment, the NPV amount trend was higher in the high reliability
condition than in the low reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = -63.47\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-100.00,~-26.94]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = -3.44\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>, whereas in low
alignment, there was no significant difference between reliability conditions,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 4.35\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-34.52,~43.21]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 0.22\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .825\)</span>. This shows that people
used the reliability information to moderate their allocations, but only did so
when projects were similar and not when they were dissimilar.</p>
<p>The comparison with the no NPV condition revealed the expected pattern. In high
alignment, the linear NPV trend was only significantly lower in the no NPV
condition than the high reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 75.70\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([39.17,~112.24]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 4.11\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>, and not the low
reliability condition, <span class="math inline">\(M = 12.24\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-27.94,~52.41]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 0.60\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .547\)</span>.
However, in low alignment, the linear NPV trend was significantly lower in the
no NPV condition than both the low reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 64.63\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([25.76,~103.50]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 3.29\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>, and the high
reliability condition, <span class="math inline">\(M = 60.29\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([24.14,~96.43]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 3.30\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>.</p>

<p>The ranking, confidence, and forecast mean data were all largely congruent with

<p>Experiment 1 found evidence for the effect of alignment on laypeople’s
decision-making in resource allocation scenarios. Specifically, when projects
were comparable, people used NPV when they were told that it was reliable, but
not when they were told that it was unreliable. However, they used NPV
regardless of reliability when it was the only shared dimension across products.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 manipulated <em>verbal</em> NPV reliability. That is, participants were
explicitly told whether NPV was considered to be a reliable metric or not.
However, in the real-world the reliability of a metric is more commonly
expressed in numerical form, such as a range around and estimate. Experiment 2
will attempt to replicate the alignment effects, but while manipulating the
<em>numerical</em> NPV reliability associated with each project, rather than the verbal
reliability as used in Experiment 2. Further, people with sufficient experience
with financial theory and analysis might be able to successfully draw inferences
from such information. Therefore, Experiment 2 used a sample of Masters of
Management students, instead of the laypeople used in Experiment 1.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Experiment 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alignment-3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 2 investigated the effects of alignment and numerically-expressed
variance information on financial resource allocation decisions. In Experiment 1
the information about the variance inherent in the NPVs was communicated
explicitly as the conclusion (e.g., “NPV is unreliable”). In Experiment 2
however, only the actual variance information itself was communicated without
the conclusion about its reliability. Specifically, participants saw the range
of predicted values (akin to a confidence interval). Therefore, while
Experiment 1 manipulated <em>verbal</em> reliability, Experiment 2 manipulated
<em>numerical</em> reliability. Further, Experiment 2 studied participants with more
business experience than the previously used laypeople samples. This experiment
tested whether the previous findings of an alignment effect will replicate with
people with more business experience. Further the experiment tested whether this
population is sensitive to variance in forecasts.</p>
<p>Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a> was again tested to
investigate the alignment effect in the new sample. However, the other
hypotheses from Experiment 1 were not tested again because Experiment 2
manipulated numerical reliability and did not include a no NPV condition.
Research has shown that people are poor at reasoning with numerical variance
information <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-batteux2020" role="doc-biblioref">Batteux et al., 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">Konold et al., 1993</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-vivalt2021" role="doc-biblioref">Vivalt &amp; Coville, 2021</a>)</span>. Therefore,
Experiment 2 tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 4.8  (No effect of numerical reliability)  </strong></span>The NPV amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount interaction will not be significant
in either alignment condition.
</div>
<p>Experiment 2 also investigated the potential to quickly change participants’
understanding, if they did not initially use numerical reliability for their
allocations. Therefore, participants were presented with a short lecture on the
importance of paying attention variance in financial decision-making. However,
results were inconclusive, so see Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-3-appendix">B.2</a>, for a
more detailed discussion. Further, Experiment 2 investigated whether
participants would have a higher sense of understanding NPV than they really do
<span class="citation">(as in <a href="references.html#ref-long2018" role="doc-biblioref">Long et al., 2018</a>)</span>. These results are also reported in

were used to calculate the NPV. In the low numerical reliability condition, the
ranges were <span class="math inline">\(\pm85\)</span>% around the mean (e.g., $150-$1850 if the forecast mean was

ranges should indicate low reliability in the measure, while narrow ranges

<p>A within-subjects factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of
NPV amount, alignment, and numerical NPV reliability on participants’ project
allocations. Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:plot-alignment-3-allocation">4.7</a> shows these data. The
alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV amount interaction was

However, this appears to be driven by the difference between alignment
conditions in the interaction between the quadratic NPV amount trend and
reliability amount,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -42.28\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-76.96,~-7.59]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(53) = -3.14\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .011\)</span>, even after

<p>Experiment 2 replicated the alignment effect found in Experiment 1 with
participants with real-world business experience. Further, Experiment 2 found
evidence for Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>, as people
seemed to rely more on NPV when faced with a set of dissimilar project than when
projects were all from the same domain. Experiment 2 also found evidence for
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3">4.8</a>, with no
significant differences between the numerical reliability amount conditions.
While Experiment 2 did not replicate the interaction found in Experiment 1, it
should be emphasised that these are two different effects. In Experiment 1,
participants were explicitly told about the reliability of the NPV measure,
whereas in Experiment 2, they were provided with variance information that
merely implies NPV reliability. Thus, Experiment 2 showed that business students
are affected by comparability of project sets, but not by numerical NPV
reliability information. Specifically, participants appeared to only focus on
the NPV itself, and not on any variations in the underlying noisiness of the
measure for a specific project.</p>
<p>However, it is unclear whether laypeople would also display this variance
neglect. Further, in Experiments 1 and 2, the business projects consisted of a
limited number of domains. It is unclear to what extent these specific domains
influenced the results. These projects were centred around consumer products,
which were originally chosen to be more easily accessible to participants
without business experience. However, with these projects, individual features
do not necessarily indicate a project’s profitability. For instance, a laptop
with a low capacity can be more profitable than a laptop with a high capacity
due to the existence of consumer goods markets. Experiment 3 addressed these
limitations.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the last two experiments was the potential presentation
style confound. The two alignment conditions differed in the number of alignable
differences, but also in the way that the information was presented. The
information in the low alignment condition was presented in paragraphs, whereas
the information in the high alignment condition was presented in tables. While
it is likely that each of these data types would be presented in this way in a
business setting, it is important to rule out that this manipulation did not
also unnecessarily increase task difficulty. Therefore, Experiment 3 attempted
to replicate this effect, while controlling for presentation style.</p>

</h2>
<p>Experiment 3 investigated the effects of alignment, reliability type, NPV
amount, and reliability amount on allocations. Experiment 1 manipulated
reliability amount by using <em>verbal</em> prompts. That is, participants were told
explicitly whether or not NPV was reliable for a certain project industry.
Experiment 2 investigated whether people were able to extract this same kind of
reliability information from <em>numerical</em> prompts. That is, participants saw NPVs
with either wide or narrow ranges, indicating either low or high reliability of
the metric, respectively. However, Experiment 1 sampled laypeople, whereas
Experiment 2 sampled a Masters of Management course. Therefore, it was not
possible to compare the two reliability types (verbal and numerical) without
ruling out the potential confound of population type. As such, Experiment 3
manipulated NPV amount, alignment, and reliability amount, but also added a
reliability type factor. Further, presentation style was a possible confound in
the alignment manipulation of the previous experiments. That is, the business
projects in the high alignment condition were always displayed as a part of a
table, whereas the projects in the low alignment condition were displayed in
prose, as paragraphs. Experiment 3 fixed this by using the same presentation
style across alignment condition.</p>
<p>The expected pattern of results in the verbal reliability condition of
Experiment 3 was a replication of Experiment 1. A pilot experiment (detailed in
Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-7">B.8</a>) found no significant differences in a similar
numerical reliability condition to the one used in Experiment 3. This was
therefore expected also for the present numerical reliability condition. The
appendix shows a simulation of these hypothesised effects (see
Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-simulation-alignment-8">B.19</a>). Therefore, as well as again
testing
Hypotheses <a href="alignment.html#hyp:three-way-alignment-2">4.1</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2">4.3</a>, <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2">4.4</a>,

<p>Participants saw similar instructions to the previous experiments, with an added
explanation of the NPV reliability information for each reliability type
condition (see Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#instructions-materials-alignment-8-appendix">B.3.1.2.1</a>).
Further, they completed a test of basic NPV understanding. This test was

<p>The project displays were similar to the previous experiments. However, here
participants saw the same presentation style in both alignment conditions. Each
display had a table describing the projects in the set, with ranking and
allocation inputs. The project details were presented as dot points within the
relevant cells of the table.

<p>Three elements were counterbalanced: 1. the association of reliability amount
and project set (two variations), 2. the association of business name with NPV
(five latin square variations), and 3. project variation (five variations per

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV amount,
alignment, NPV reliability amount, and NPV reliability type on participants’
project allocations. Figure <a href="alignment.html#fig:plot-alignment-8-allocation">4.10</a> shows these

Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#results-alignment-8-allocation">B.3.2.1</a>. The predicted four-way
interaction (alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>
reliability type) was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(3.20, 1,420.19) = 0.71\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .555\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .002\)</span>. However, most of the

<p>The three-way interaction (alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV
amount) in the verbal reliability condition was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 13.42\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-1.27,~28.11]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 1.80\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .073\)</span>. This is
most likely due to the size of the two-way interactions in each alignment
condition being relatively similar, despite the expectation of no interaction in
the low alignment condition (as was seen in Experiment 1). In high alignment,
the interaction between the linear NPV amount trend and NPV reliability amount
was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -36.63\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-47.02,~-26.25]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -6.93\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.
Specifically, the trend was stronger in the high reliability amount condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 27.26\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([17.69,~36.83]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 5.60\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>,
than in the low reliability amount condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -9.38\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-18.86,~0.11]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -1.94\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .053\)</span>.
This shows that, as in Experiment 1, participants moderate their allocations
based on verbally-expressed NPV reliability.</p>
<p>Contrary to Experiment 1, the interaction between the linear NPV amount trend
and NPV reliability amount was also significant in the low alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -23.21\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-33.60,~-12.83]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = -4.39\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.
This suggests that participants were also able to moderate their allocations
based on verbal reliability in the low alignment condition. Despite the lack of
a three-way interaction in the verbal reliability condition (that would have
indicated a difference in the two alignment two-way interactions), the linear
NPV amount trend was stronger in the low alignment condition than in the high
alignment condition when averaging over reliability amount,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 28.97\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([17.68,~40.26]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 5.04\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>. This
suggests that when NPV reliability was expressed verbally, as in Experiment 1,
participants relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar than when they
were similar.</p>

<p>In the numerical reliability condition, the linear NPV amount trend was not
significantly “equivalent” between those in the low and high alignment
conditions (averaging over reliability amount),
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 15.19\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([3.90,~26.48]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.64\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .996\)</span>. In
fact, a post-hoc comparison suggests that the low alignment trend was stronger
(with Bonferroni adjustment),
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 15.19\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.78,~29.60]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.64\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .034\)</span>. This is
the same pattern as in the verbal reliability condition above and in
Experiment 2. Further, the linear NPV trend was not significantly different
between reliability amount conditions in both the low alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 1.64\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-11.61,~14.90]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 0.31\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; .999\)</span>,

This shows that participants did not use numerical reliability to moderate their
allocations.</p>

and <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2">4.4</a> were supported in the
verbal reliability condition. This shows that while overall participants prefer
to use NPV as a proxy for project quality in their allocations, they still use
verbal reliability information. Specifically, when projects are similar, people
use NPV when they are told that it is reliable, and use alternative metrics when
told that it is not reliable. However, Experiment 3 did not find evidence for
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2">4.5</a>. Instead,
Experiment 3 found that even in the low alignment condition, participants still
moderated their use of NPV. They still used NPV regardless of reliability
condition, shown by the positive NPV amount trend in both reliability
conditions. However, Experiment 3 shows that participants still used NPV less
when told that it was unreliable.</p>
<p>Further, Experiment 3 did not find support for
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:four-way-alignment-8">4.9</a> mostly likely because of the
unexpected effects of NPV amount in the numerical reliability condition. The
hypothesis was constructed in response to the results of a pilot study
(documented in Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-7">B.8</a>) that replicated the results of
Experiment 1 in the verbal reliability condition, but did not replicate the
results of Experiment 2 in the numerical reliability condition. That is, when
faced with numerical ranges as variance information, people did not seem to even
use the midpoint in their decisions. Experiment 3, on the other hand, replicated
the finding of Experiment 2 in the numerical reliability condition.
Specifically, people used NPV more when projects were dissimilar, but
critically, they did not use numerical range information to moderate their
allocations.</p>

</h2>
<p>Across three experiments there were two main findings: 1. NPV is used more when
options are hard to compare; and 2. people do not consider numerical variance
information, despite this being important to the reliability of the NPV
forecasts. These effects were consistent across both naive and experienced
populations, which indicates their persistence. People make use of metrics with
alignable differences when in a situation that requires comparison across
disparate options. However, they do not sufficiently moderate their use of such
metrics even when they have alternative attributes to use.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 found that when participants were told that NPV was unreliable,
they did not use it in their allocation decisions, but when they were told that
it was reliable they did. Experiment 2 found that people with some business
experience relied on NPV more for resource allocation when the rest of the
information was non-alignable, compared to when it was alignable. However,
participants did not take into account the numerical reliability information
when making these decisions. Experiment 3 found further evidence of these
effects, within one experimental design.</p>
<p>Alignable differences have been shown to be important to decision making in many
settings <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-markman2010" role="doc-biblioref">Markman &amp; Loewenstein, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-markman1995" role="doc-biblioref">Markman &amp; Medin, 1995</a>)</span>. The experiments in this chapter are novel
in the investigation of alignment effects in a resource allocation paradigm.
Further, these experiments considered the extent to which the reliability of an
alignable measure (NPV) affects its use in choice. The experiments found that
this is dependent on the availability of other alignable differences in the
choice set. If other alignable differences are available, then participants are
willing to reduce their use of a supposedly unreliable alignable measure (and
use it when told that it is reliable). However, when no other alignable
differences are available, then the unreliable, but alignable, measure is used
less. This was found in both Experiment 1 and 3, as well as to lesser extent in
a pilot study (reported in Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-1">B.4</a>).</p>
<p>Financial measures such as NPV are useful because of their alignability. That
is, they act as an alignable difference regardless of the inherent similarity of
a set of projects. Psychologically, these measures are useful because they allow
for relevant inferences <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lassaline1996" role="doc-biblioref">Lassaline, 1996</a>)</span> and because they offer an abstraction
of concrete details <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-doumas2013" role="doc-biblioref">Doumas &amp; Hummel, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the theoretical account of structural alignment does not directly speak
to the real-world implications when there is a need for non-alignable
comparisons. NPV is a type of abstraction that allows comparison between
different aspects of a company. For instance, comparing an oil field project
with a refinery project might be made easier by using NPV. On the other hand,
this increased alignment might actually hide important information because it
does not consider the finer complexities inherent within each business unit. The
forecasts that are the basis of NPV are based on different indicators in each
business unit, there are likely differences in variance between each unit’s
estimates. As such, one can imagine a continuum of similarity comparisons in
which usefulness of comparison increases with the level of alignability, but is
moderated by the level of abstraction that is required to make the alignment.</p>
<p>The finding that people, even with some business experience, do not sufficiently
consider variance information is surprising, but understandable. It is
surprising because so much of financial decision making depends on considering
different sources of variance (e.g., risk, volatility, and uncertainty).
However, it is understandable because research from psychology and statistics
education shows that statistics students and people in general have a poor
ability to draw statistical inferences <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-galesic2010" role="doc-biblioref">Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-konold1993" role="doc-biblioref">Konold et al., 1993</a>)</span>. Future
research should investigate the conditions under which people’s sensitivity to
variance information can be facilitated. For instance, it is unclear whether it
is merely salience that is lacking, and that therefore visual aids could be
useful, or whether further explicit explanation of the statistical inference is
necessary. Pilot experiments suggest that participants still struggle to use
numerical reliability information, even when given very explicit instructions
(see Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-6">B.7</a>).</p>
<p>A possible limitation of these experiments is the use of NPV as the only
financial metric. In the business world there are many metrics that serve
similar functions and would be used as a tool to deal with non-alignable
options, as NPV was in the current study. Therefore, future research should
attempt to replicate the current findings with different financial measures.</p>
<p>Future research should also investigate the boundary conditions of the
reliability effect. That is, people seem to be responding to explicit
reliability information, but not to variance information that implies
reliability. Future research should attempt to identify the minimal kind of
information about variance that participants need in order to understand the
relevant implications about reliability. Participants may simply not notice the
variability information, or assume that it irrelevant. For instance, future
research could test participants in a condition in which the variability
information is more salient.</p>
