<p>A good story is often more persuasive than data. While usually harmless in daily
settings, poor judgement due to a bias towards anecdotal evidence can lead to
larger-scale negative consequences. Perhaps the most prominent example of such
an error in judgement is the belief that a vaccine causes a certain disorder
based on isolated stories, despite contradictory scientific evidence. An
analogous error exists in settings such as managerial decision-making. In
business, managers use analogies, usually called <em>case studies</em>, as a part of
strategic decision-making. Case studies are examples of previous situations that
are considered similar by the decision-maker and are used to draw inferences
about a target problem. When comparing such examples with aggregated data these
are called anecdotes.</p>
<p>Many businesses use case studies to inform their decisions, but often struggle
to use them successfully <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gavetti2005a" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, 2005</a>)</span>. This is likely because of the high
salience of companies that have ended up either very successful or very
unsuccessful. That is, people are often uninterested in average outcomes, but
are captivated by both positive and negative extreme outcomes. Increased
salience of an anecdote may increase its influence above useful statistical
data. Further, increased anecdote salience may also shift attention away from
structural similarities in favour of more surface similarities. Both of these
issues may explain unsuccessful use of case studies.</p>
<p>The first consideration when using a case study is its merit relative to
available aggregated statistical data. That is, if the case study is a single
data point in a set of other relevant cases, then using the statistical
properties of the larger sample is more inferentially informative than using a
single case from within the sample (unlike perhaps when the single case is
somehow the most relevant example from the sample). Despite the utility and
availability of large sample data, research has shown that people can prefer
anecdotal evidence over statistical data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">Freling et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>; e.g., <a href="#ref-reinard1988" role="doc-biblioref">Reinard, 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-shen2015" role="doc-biblioref">Shen et al., 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, if this larger sample is not available (or is ignored), then the second
consideration when using a case study is the extent of its similarity to the
target problem. Research on the psychology of similarity judgements
distinguishes between surface and relational similarity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner, 1983</a>)</span>. The
consensus of this research is that the more conceptual structures two cases
share, the more useful they are in decision-making <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lassaline1996" role="doc-biblioref">Lassaline, 1996</a>; <a href="#ref-markman1995" role="doc-biblioref">Markman &amp; Medin, 1995</a>)</span>. As such, case studies that are similar to a target problem on a
merely surface level are less useful than those that are related by shared
conceptual structure.</p>
<p>Previous research has considered the role of similarity and analogical reasoning
in business-related decision-making <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-gavetti2005" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti et al., 2005</a>)</span>. Other work has
investigated the impact of anecdotes in capital allocation decisions, and
separately the impact of similarity on anecdotes (summarised below). However, it
is unclear to what extent an anecdote’s similarity to the target problem will
affect the influence of anecdotes in capital allocation decisions. Further, it
is unclear whether people will be sensitive to information about the
distribution from which the anecdote was sampled.</p>

</h3>
<p>Anecdotal bias is the finding that anecdotal evidence sometimes influences
people’s beliefs more than statistical evidence. Journalists, for instance, are
well aware of the power of anecdotes. An analysis of approximately 29,000 New
York Times editorials showed a reliance on anecdotes to drive arguments
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-alkhatib2017" role="doc-biblioref">Al Khatib et al., 2017</a>)</span>. While some research concluded that statistics are more
persuasive than anecdotes <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-allen1997" role="doc-biblioref">Allen &amp; Preiss, 1997</a>; <a href="#ref-hoeken2001" role="doc-biblioref">Hoeken, 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-hornikx2005" role="doc-biblioref">Hornikx, 2005</a>)</span> and
others were equivocal <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-winterbottom2008" role="doc-biblioref">Winterbottom et al., 2008</a>)</span>, a number of studies have found
evidence for anecdotal bias <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-ratcliff2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ratcliff &amp; Sun, 2020</a>; e.g., <a href="#ref-reinard1988" role="doc-biblioref">Reinard, 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-reinhart2006" role="doc-biblioref">Reinhart, 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-shen2015" role="doc-biblioref">Shen et al., 2015</a>)</span>. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-zebregs2015" role="doc-biblioref">Zebregs et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-zebregs2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> suggested that this disparity in
findings might be due to statistics having an effect on beliefs and attitudes,
and anecdotes affecting intention. A more recent meta-analysis of 61 studies
showed that overall people find statistical evidence more persuasive than
anecdotal evidence <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">Freling et al., 2020</a>)</span>. However, even if statistical evidence is
overall more persuasive across studies, anecdotes that add no additional
information to co-presented statistics still influence judgement
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Further, the meta-analysis found that people tend to prefer
anecdotal evidence over statistical data when the stakes are more emotional,
medical, or relevant to the decision-maker. In business, the decisions are
clearly relevant to the decision-maker.</p>

<p>It is important to investigate anecdotal bias in business because of the
implications this might have on managers’ use of case studies. There are many
cases of managers successfully using analogies from anecdotal cases, but also of
failures to analogise properly <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gavetti2005" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-gavetti2005a" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, 2005</a>)</span>. There is very
little research on anecdotal bias in business, but the existing work finds clear
evidence of the effect. In fact, the recent meta-analysis by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">Freling et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> only
included the work in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> as one such paper.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> gave a sample of managers and other professionals a choice between
two audit firms, which varied in their audit deficiencies for various clients.
The experiment was designed in a way that the statistical evidence favoured one
firm and the anecdotal evidence favoured the other firm. Participants viewed one
of five conditions. In the <em>anecdote only</em> condition, they were shown examples
of firm deficiencies; whereas in the <em>anecdote &amp; statistics</em> condition, they
were shown the same as in the anecdote condition, but also saw the number of
deficiencies and clients. However, participants were not explicitly provided the
proportions for these values. In the <em>statistics only</em> condition, the
proportions and clients without deficiencies were made explicit. The <em>anecdote &amp;
enhanced statistics</em> condition added the anecdotes to the statistics only
condition. The terminology here is confusing because nothing about the way the
statistics are presented to the participants is “enhanced” beyond how they are
presented in the statistics only condition. However, the <em>anecdote &amp; enhanced
statistics—judgment orientation</em> condition emphasised the importance of
proportions and keeping absolute numbers in their relevant context.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> found evidence for anecdotal bias. They measured the proportion of
participants choosing the firm favoured by the statistical data. Those that saw
only the anecdote chose this firm equivalently to those that saw both the
anecdote and the statistics. Further, participants chose this firm less when
seeing both types of information than when seeing just statistics, even when the
underlying proportions were made explicit (anecdote &amp; enhanced statistics
condition). This provided evidence of anecdotal bias, as participants ignored
contradictory statistical data.</p>
<p>Finding no difference between the anecdote &amp; statistics condition and the
anecdote only condition implies that the anecdotal bias effect is “complete.”
That is, this shows that the statistics displayed did not play a role in
influencing choice. A “partial” effect would have been one in which the anecdote
&amp; statistics condition had been chosen more than the anecdote only condition.
This would mean that statistics still played some role in influencing choice.</p>
<p>The other important finding in this work was that highlighting relevant
statistical features and providing some explanation of statistical inference
reduced the anecdotal bias. This is important because it suggests that potential
psychological biases can be reduced with a re-framing of the provided
information and an explanation of the relevant statistical concepts.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> conducted a similar study to <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, but with a capital
budgeting task, as opposed to a binary choice. Participants had to choose
between purchasing three production-line machines for a mid-sized company that
prints circuit boards. The provided statistical data suggested that Machine A
was better than Machine B, which was better than Machine C. Participants were
either given only this information, or were also provided with an anecdote. This
anecdote was in the form of an email correspondence from a colleague from
another company that recommended against Machine A (the best option). As in
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, participants were assigned to <em>anecdote &amp; statistics</em> and
<em>statistics only</em> conditions. In the <em>judgment orientation I</em> and <em>judgment
orientation II</em> conditions, participants were told to “think like a scientist”
and either received an explanation of what this means, which was either short or
a long, respectively. These explanations emphasised the importance of
statistical inference.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> found evidence for anecdotal bias. Including a contradictory
anecdote alongside statistical evidence (the anecdote &amp; statistics condition)
reduced the proportion of choosing Machine A. They also found that the addition
of instructions that emphasised scientific thinking reduced this bias. Unlike
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> could not determine whether this was a complete or
partial anecdotal bias because they did not use an anecdote only condition.
Further, neither work considered the effect of the similarity of the content of
the anecdote to the target problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="effect-of-similarity" class="section level3" number="6.1.3">

<span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Effect of similarity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#effect-of-similarity"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The extent of one’s reliance on an anecdote should arguably be moderated by its
similarity to the target problem. Previous work has discussed the importance of
weighting previous cases by their similarity to the present situation
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gilboa1995" role="doc-biblioref">Gilboa &amp; Schmeidler, 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-lovallo2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo et al., 2012</a>)</span>. For instance, consider a medical treatment that
with contradictory statistical and anecdotal evidence. A large-scale aggregated
study found 99% efficacy of the treatment, while an individual reports on social
media that they became sick as a side-effect of the treatment. On the one hand,
an individual’s decision of whether to use the treatment should be informed more
by the aggregated data than by the anecdote. On the other hand, the individual
might have reason to be concerned if the person who became sick was the
individual’s identical twin. The inference that the individual may therefore
also need to be cautious about the treatment arises from a specific causal model
based on the two cases’ shared genetics.</p>
<p>There have been mixed results regarding the effect of anecdote similarity on the
extent of anecdotal bias. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-hoeken2009" role="doc-biblioref">Hoeken &amp; Hustinx</a> (<a href="#ref-hoeken2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>Study 3)</span> found evidence for an effect of
similarity on anecdotal bias with laypeople for a variety of claims. As well as
manipulating whether participants received a claim supported by an anecdote or
statistical evidence, they manipulated whether the anecdotal evidence was
similar or dissimilar to the claim that it was supporting. They found that
similar anecdotes were more persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-hoeken2001" role="doc-biblioref">Hoeken</a> (<a href="#ref-hoeken2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>
did not find evidence for an effect of similarity about a local government
proposal with a student sample. Similarly, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-hornikx2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hornikx</a> (<a href="#ref-hornikx2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> considered the effect of
similarity on anecdotal bias in local government policy decision-making. The
researchers did not find an effect of similarity, or an effect of anecdotes.
However, they measured persuasiveness and perhaps requiring to make more
concrete decisions will be a better test for a more real-life scenario.</p>
<p>Apart from the need to clarify the effect of similarity on the anecdotal bias
effect, it is important to clarify how such an effect might work. Research on
analogical reasoning has made the distinction between simple surface similarity
and deeper relational similarity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner, 1983</a>)</span>. As mentioned above, one’s use
of an anecdote should be moderated by the extent to which it is associated by an
underlying casual mechanism or mere surface similarity. Imagine a manager of a
multi-divisional company that is deciding how to allocate capital between an oil
well project and a technology project. Would hearing of a recent failed oil well
project at a different company influence the manager’s allocation decision? If
so, would it influence the decision because of the fact that the anecdote and
one of the target projects are from the same industry (surface similarity)? Or
would the manager look to the underlying reason of why the anecdote failed and
first identify if this mechanism is relevant to the target oil project
(relational similarity)? The experiments in this chapter investigate whether the
anecdotal bias effect is due to causal inductive reasoning or merely the
association between the valence of the anecdote and surface similarity with the
target.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.1.4</span> Experiment summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#experiment-summary-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Experiment 1 investigated whether anecdotal bias in a capital allocation
paradigm is moderated by similarity of the anecdotes. Further, it tested whether
giving extra information about statistical thinking would encourage participants
to consider the statistics over the anecdote. Experiment 1 used a negative
anecdote, which is an example of an unsuccessful case. This kind of anecdote has
been shown to produce anecdotal bias in both medical <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>)</span> and
business <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg, 2018</a>)</span> decision-making. However, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> found less of
a bias in positive anecdotes, which are examples of successful cases, and
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> did not consider these at all. Therefore, Experiment 2 attempted
to replicate the effect of similarity on anecdotal bias with a positive valence
anecdote. Further, Experiment 2 provided participants with information about the
sample distribution of the anecdote, whereas Experiment 1 did not. This allowed
for an informal test of whether people are sensitive to such information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Experiment 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#anecdotes-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 1 investigated the effects of similarity and anecdotal bias on
capital allocation. Participants were asked to allocate a hypothetical budget
between two business projects. They also saw a case study that was either
similar or dissimilar to the target project (but still from the same industry).
Further, participants were allocated to the same conditions as in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>,
except that of the two judgement orientation conditions, only the <em>judgment
orientation II</em> condition was used. Further, an anecdote only condition was
used. For the conditions with statistical evidence, participants also saw
aggregated information about the success of similar projects in the form of Net
Present Value (NPV) as well as a reliability measure. One project was clearly
better than the other when considering the statistical data, but the anecdotal
evidence suggested the opposite.</p>
<p>Previous research found that people are more persuaded by negative anecdotes
than by positive statistical data in capital allocation scenarios
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg, 2018</a>)</span>. While other work has shown that similar anecdotes are more
persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hoeken2009" role="doc-biblioref">Hoeken &amp; Hustinx, 2009</a>; Study 3)</span>, it is unclear how
similarity changes the anecdotal bias effect. As such, the main question was
whether anecdotal bias will be greater when the anecdote is similar than when it
is dissimilar. The target project was supported by the statistics, but is
inconsistent with the anecdotes. Further, Experiment 1 only used negative
anecdotes. So, evidence of anecdotal bias is given when allocation in a
statistics only condition is higher than allocation to an anecdote &amp; statistics
condition. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.1  (Anecdotal bias is moderated by the similarity of negative anecdotes)  </strong></span>Allocations to the target project will be higher when only the statistics are
presented and when the statistics are accompanied by a low similarity anecdote,
in comparison to when the statistics are accompanied by a high similarity
anecdote. In addition, allocations are predicted to not be affected by the low
similarity anecdote at all. That is, the statistics only condition should not
differ from the low similarity anecdote &amp; statistics condition.
</div>
<p>Experiment 1 predicted that that the anecdotal bias effect will be complete, as
in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Specifically, the participants presented with the high
similarity anecdote along with the statistics will not use any statistical
information. Testing the high similarity condition will allow for an equivalent
test to <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.2  (Effect of statistics for negative anecdotes)  </strong></span>Participants will allocate capital equivalently to the target project when in
the high similarity anecdote &amp; statistics condition and when in the high
similarity anecdote only condition without enhancing the statistics explanation.
</div>
<p>Participants with additional information explaining the importance of
“scientific thinking” and statistical data may be less affected by anecdotes, as

<p>All participants initially saw general instructions that explained the task. The

condition. Those in the anecdote only condition were told that they will see a
case study of a failed project and an analysis of why it failed. Those in the

information as a part of the descriptions of the two focal projects.
Participants were explained that these values were sourced from a study with a
large sample. Those in the anecdote &amp; statistics condition were given both of
these instructions, and were also told that the information in the anecdote is
subsumed in the data of the aggregated study. Those in the anecdote &amp; enhanced
statistics condition saw the same as those in the anecdote &amp; statistics
condition, but were subsequently given the explanation of scientific thinking
that <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> used.

</h5>
<p>In the allocation task, participants allocated a percentage of a hypothetical
budget between two projects that come from different businesses within a
company. In this chapter, these two projects will be referred to as the <em>focal</em>
projects. One of these projects will be referred to as the <em>target</em> project and
the other as the <em>comparison</em> project. The target project was used as a
reference for the similarity manipulation. That is, the anecdote was either high
or low in similarity compared to the target project. Further, the data analyses
presented in Section <a href="anecdotes.html#results-anecdotes-1">6.2.2</a> used allocations to the target
project as the DV. The comparison project was simply the other focal project to
which participants were allocating. It was always a different type of project to
both the target and anecdote projects.</p>
<p>Participants were presented with information about each business’ name,
location, integration (vertical or horizontal), and organisational structure
(centralised or decentralised). See
Appendix <a href="anecdotes-appendix.html#allocation-materials-anecdotes-1">C.1.1.2.2</a> for an explanation of these
terms. Further, participants were presented with information about features of
each project that they were told were available to managers before the time of
investment. Participants in the anecdote only condition saw just this
information (see
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:project-allocation-anecdote-only-materials-anecdotes-1">6.1</a>), while
those in the statistics conditions saw this information along with measures of
NPV and “Overall reliability rating” (see
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:project-allocation-statistics-materials-anecdotes-1">6.2</a>).
Participants entered their allocation data underneath this table, in two
textboxes labelled <em>Project A allocation</em> and <em>Project B allocation</em>,
respectively.</p>

<p>Participants that were presented with an anecdote (those in either the anecdote
only, anecdote &amp; statistics, or anecdote &amp; enhanced statistics conditions) saw a
description of a business project and an accompanying “analysis.”
Figures <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:anecdote-similarity-high-materials-anecdotes-1">6.3</a>
and <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:anecdote-similarity-low-materials-anecdotes-1">6.4</a> show the anecdote
display for those in the high and low similarity conditions, respectively. The
project description had a similar layout to that of the focal projects. That is,
it contained information about the business name, location, integration, and
organisational structure of the business. It also detailed several predicted
features of the project. Underneath this description was a paragraph of text
that participants were told was an analysis of why the project failed. This text
referenced each of the features in the description in order to justify the
project failing.</p>
<p>Those in the high similarity condition saw a description of a project from a
business with the same type of investment as the target project (labelled
Project A). All categorical attributes were identical to those in this target
project, and the numerical attributes were all made to be lower. In the
analysis, the numerical attributes were explained to have failed because they
were not as high as certain cut-offs. Critically, these cut-offs were made to
all be higher than the relevant values in Project A. This was done to make sure
that the numerical attributes in the anecdote seem more relevant to those in
Project A. For instance, for Project A, oil extraction was 2200L an hour, for
the anecdote it was 2000L an hour, and the cutoff was 3000L an hour. As such, a
failure of the anecdote because of an insufficient oil extraction rated will
seem more relevant since they both share the state of being lower than the
cut-off in the analysis. Note, however, that there was uncertainty about the
generalisability of these cut-off values because the participants did not
receive an explicit indication of whether these values were meant to generalise
to other cases.</p>

<p>A two-way ANOVA was conducted to investigate the interaction of similarity (low

Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-1-allocation">6.6</a> shows these data. This identified

Specifically, the difference between allocations when only seeing an anecdote

similar,

that specific relevance ratings were related to allocations, but only in the

the connection between the anecdote and target, as opposed to simply reacting to
the failed project and associating that with that project’s industry.</p>

<p>Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1">6.1</a> was supported.
Participants allocated less capital when seeing the anecdote with statistics
than when seeing the statistics alone. This effect was moderated by similarity,
however, as it was seen in the high similarity condition, but not in the low
similarity condition. This shows that while anecdotal bias exists when the
anecdote is similar, participants are not influenced when the causal mechanisms
do not match. Contrary to Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1">6.2</a>, despite
being influenced by the anecdote, participants still made some use of the
statistics. This is different from <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, who found no difference
between an anecdote only and an anecdote &amp; statistics condition, indicating a
complete effect of anecdotal bias.
Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1">6.3</a> was also not supported, as
the added enhanced statistical language used to encourage participants to use
the statistical information did not contribute to reducing participants’
reliance on anecdotes.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 was limited because it only considered an anecdote with a
<em>negative</em> valence. That is, the case study was of a project that failed. In
real life, however, these case studies are often ones with <em>positive</em> valence.
That is, a story of a successful company. In fact, in business, the anecdotes
that are used might be more likely to be positive, because of survivorship bias.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> found an anecdotal bias effect in negative anecdotes, but not in
positive anecdotes. This may be because the stimuli consisted of medical
decisions and in this domain a loss of health may be felt stronger than an
equivalent gain of health. Experiment 2 added a condition with a positive
anecdote, in order to investigate whether anecdote valence will impact the
anecdotal bias effect.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the effects found in Experiment 1 were related to
participants’ perceptions of the type of sampling used in selecting the
anecdotes. The instructions in Experiment 1 did not explain how the anecdote
displayed to participants was chosen. Whether sampling is believed to be
intentional or random has been shown to affect people’s decision-making <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-hayes2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hayes et al., 2019</a>)</span>. In the case of the current experiments, the sampling assumption
changes the extent to which it is rational to use the anecdote or not. It may be
rational to choose the anecdote over the aggregated data if 1. the anecdote was
not sampled randomly from the pool of anecdotes, and 2. the anecdote is more
similar to the target project than any of the other anecdotes in the pool in
relevant ways. That is, if the anecdote was chosen because of its high relevance
to the target project, it would be irrational to ignore it. In Experiment 1 it
was unclear whether participants might have held these beliefs. In order to
control for these assumptions, in Experiment 2, text was added to the
instructions that clarified that the anecdote 1. was sampled randomly from the
pool of anecdotes, and 2. is not significantly more similar to the target
project than any of the other anecdotes in the pool.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Experiment 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#anecdotes-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 1 replicated the anecdotal bias effect found in the literature. That
is, people used an anecdote more when presented with conflicting statistics than
with anecdote alone and less than with statistics alone. However, anecdote
similarity moderated this effect, such that anecdotal bias was stronger when the
anecdote was similar to the current task, than when it was dissimilar.
Experiment 1 only used a negative anecdote because previous research found
anecdotal bias for negative, but not for positive anecdotes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>)</span>.
However, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> considered medical decision-making, so this effect of
anecdote valence may be different in a business context. In the study, the
positive anecdote involved a treatment that led to a reduction in symptoms and
the negative anecdote involved symptoms persisting. This framing might mean
participants represented the positive anecdote as a return to a reference point
and the negative anecdote as a continuation of a reduction in well-being,
relative to the reference point. In business, however, both successful and
failed business projects represents a deviation from a reference point. To test
this difference further, Experiment 2 added an anecdote valence manipulation</p>
<p>In order to increase the experiment’s power, anecdote valence and anecdote
similarity were manipulated within-subjects. Further, Experiment 2 did not
include the anecdote &amp; enhanced statistics manipulation, because Experiment 1
did not find evidence for its effect. All participants saw the statistics only
condition, as it did not contain an anecdote, and therefore did not need to be
manipulated between-subjects. Each participant therefore saw five displays: one
display for the statistics only condition; and four displays for either the
anecdote only condition, or the anecdote &amp; statistics condition. These four
anecdote displays consisted of the similarity (low and high) <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> valence
(negative and positive) conditions.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 did not clarify certain assumptions about the distribution from
which the anecdote was sampled. In Experiment 2, participants were told that the
anecdote was sampled randomly and that it was not uniquely similar to the target
project. This should lead to a reliance on the statistical evidence, regardless
of the anecdote’s similarity. However, people often struggle to use statistical
concepts presented descriptively, as seen in the enhanced statistics condition
in Experiment 1, the variance neglect in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, and the lack
of risk aggregation in descriptive risky choice as in
Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a>. Therefore, it was expected that the effects of
Experiment 1 will replicate in the negative valence condition. Further it was
expected that there will be a reverse effect in the positive valence condition.
The appendix shows a simulation of the hypothesised effects (see
Figures <a href="anecdotes-appendix.html#fig:plot-simulation-anecdotes-2-negative">C.13</a>
and <a href="anecdotes-appendix.html#fig:plot-simulation-anecdotes-2-positive">C.14</a>). Therefore, Experiment 2
tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">

</div>
<p>The main effect of interest was the moderation of anecdotal bias by similarity.
Therefore, as well as again testing
Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1">6.1</a> for negative anecdotes,
Experiment 2 tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">

be higher when the anecdote is similar than when it is dissimilar.

<p>Contrary to both <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1">6.2</a>,

<p>Ninety-six people (50 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of £5 an hour. The average age was 41.69 (<em>SD</em> = 11.29, <em>min</em> = 27, <em>max</em> = 74). Participants reported an average of 7.19 (<em>SD</em> = 8.34, <em>min</em> = 0, <em>max</em> = 43) years of work in a business setting, and an average of 3.91 (<em>SD</em> = 7.67, <em>min</em> = 0, <em>max</em> = 50) years of business education. The mean completion time was 14.98 (<em>SD</em> = 8.84, <em>min</em> = 2.57, <em>max</em> = 58.71) minutes. Table <a href="anecdotes.html#tab:condition-allocation-anecdotes-2">6.2</a>
shows the between-subjects condition allocation. Similarity and valence were
manipulated within-subjects. Therefore, each participant was in one of two
between-subjects anecdote conditions, and saw five displays (statistics only,
and one for each of the four similarity and valence conditions).

</h4>
<p>To investigate whether anecdotal bias was moderated by similarity, a difference
measure was calculated between each participant’s allocation to the statistics
only condition and their allocation to each of the two anecdote &amp; statistics
conditions (high and low similarity). The statistics only comparison value was
different for each valence condition to create equivalent comparisons. For
negative valence, the allocation to the high NPV project was used; while for
positive valence, the allocation to the low NPV project was used.
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference">6.13</a> shows these data. The
similarity <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> valence interaction was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(1, 47) = 30.66\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .395\)</span>, as was the
main effect of valence,
<span class="math inline">\(F(1, 47) = 9.85\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .003\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .173\)</span>. The main effect of
similarity was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(1, 47) = 0.53\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .469\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .011\)</span>.</p>
<p>The effect of the anecdote is represented differently for each valence
condition. As such, the interaction was analysed further by comparing the two
similarity conditions for each valence condition. For negative anecdotes, the
statistical values (e.g., NPV) associated with the target project were higher
than those for the comparison project. If participants were influenced by the
negative anecdote they would therefore allocate less to the target. For negative
anecdotes, a lower allocation to the target project is represented in
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference">6.13</a> as a positive
value—the difference in allocation from when the participant did not see an
anecdote. For positive anecdotes, the statistics were lower for the target
project, so an influence of the anecdote is seen as a negative value in
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference">6.13</a>. A moderation of the
anecdotal bias effect by similarity for negative anecdotes would suggest a
higher difference score in high similarity than in low similarity. That is, more
influence of the anecdote when it is similar than when it is dissimilar. For
positive anecdotes a moderation would suggest the reverse: a higher difference
score in low similarity than in high similarity.</p>
<p>For negative anecdotes, the allocation difference
was greater when the anecdote was similar to the target than when it was
dissimilar, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -18.17\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-26.17,~-10.17]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(93.80) = -4.51\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>. For
positive anecdotes, the allocation difference was greater when the anecdote was
dissimilar to the target than when it was similar,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 14.10\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([6.10,~22.11]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(93.80) = 3.50\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>. This provides
evidence for the moderation of anecdotal bias by similarity for both negative
and positive anecdotes. People seem to be sensitive to the relevance of the
anecdote to the target problem.</p>

participants allocated more to the high similarity anecdote &amp; statistics project

showed the same trends as in Experiment 1, the interaction was not significant.
Similarly, the ratings trends for positive anecdotes were as hypothesised, but
their interaction not significant. It appears that specific relevance ratings
were related to allocations, but only in the high similarity condition. Further,
there were no significant associations with the general relevance ratings. This
provides limited evidence that people were reasoning about the connection

and <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-2">6.5</a> were supported, as participants

Hypotheses <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-negative-anecdotes-2">6.6</a>

statistical information into their judgements, for both negative and positive

clear indication that participants were using only the specific project
information rather than merely its industry.</p>
<p>Experiment 2 therefore found that, unlike in the medical domain, the effect of
anecdotes in financial decision-making does not depend on anecdote valence.
Further, as in Experiment 1, and unlike in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, the anecdotal bias

</h2>
<p>Most of the hypotheses were supported. This chapter found that, in a capital
allocation context, people’s decisions are influenced by anecdotes even when
aggregated data are available. There were three novel findings: 1. the anecdotal
bias effect was only seen when participants considered the anecdote as
sufficiently relevant to the target project, 2. participants integrated
statistics in their decisions, and 3. these effects were found in both negative
and positive anecdotes. Further, people did not consider verbal sample
distribution information, which could have helped to moderate their decisions.
This is surprising since other work showed that generalisations are sensitive to
sampling <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-carvalho2021" role="doc-biblioref">Carvalho et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The first novel finding from these experiments was that participants moderated
their use of anecdotal evidence. Specifically, when the anecdote appeared to be
causally relevant, participants used it in their decisions. However, when it
appeared irrelevant, participants relied on statistics almost entirely. The
findings in the high similarity condition are largely congruent with findings
from other work investigating anecdotal bias in business decision-making. As in
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, this chapter found that people allocated less
capital to a project that is successful according to statistical evidence
co-presented with contradictory similar anecdote, than to a project with the
statistics alone.</p>
<p>It seems that participants made the distinction between the low and high
similarity conditions based on the underlying structure of the anecdote. The low
similarity condition always consisted of the same project type, for each domain,
as in the high similarity condition. For instance, in one variation, both the
high and low similarity anecdotes involved oil well projects. However, the high
similarity anecdotes also matched with the target project on a number of
specific features. This means that participants were sensitive to the specific
information presented to them in the anecdote description and analysis, and did
not simply use the project type for their inferences. Further, participants’
answers to the follow up questions indicated that they did not consider the
anecdote to be necessarily relevant to other projects from the same industry. In
other words, participants did not appear to carelessly use anecdotal evidence in
their decisions, but instead appeared to carefully consider the anecdote based
on its particular causal structure.</p>
<p>The second novel finding from these experiments was that participants that saw
the statistics with anecdotal evidence did not completely disregard the
statistical measures. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> found a complete effect of anecdotal bias,
because in their study the anecdote only and anecdote &amp; statistics conditions
were equivalent. This meant that the statistics they provided had a negligible
effect on participants’ decisions. The experiments in this chapter, on the other
hand, showed a partial anecdotal bias effect, seen as a difference in
allocations between the anecdote only and anecdote &amp; statistics conditions. It
seems as if participants integrated the anecdotal information with the
statistical information. This suggests that people’s evaluation of evidence
might be more sensitive than previously thought.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between these results and those in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> might be a
result of the sampled population. Since <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">Freling et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> found a stronger effect of
anecdote when decisions were more personally relevant, the manager sample in
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> may have simply been more personally invested in the task than the
laypeople in the experiments in this chapter. Similarly, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-yang2015" role="doc-biblioref">Yang et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-yang2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> found that
anxiety increases anecdotal bias in risky choice. The discrepancy might also,
however, be due to the anecdote &amp; statistics condition not being equivalent
between <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and the present work. Specifically, the statistics shown
in the anecdote &amp; statistics condition in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> were not the same ones
that were shown in the same study’s statistics only condition, unlike in both
the present experiments and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Instead, it was the anecdote &amp;
enhanced statistics condition that contained the same statistics as in the
statistics only condition. This suggests that people only integrate statistics
when they are sufficiently clear and no further interpretation is required.</p>
<p>The third novel finding from these experiments was that anecdotal bias was found
in both negative and positive anecdotes. Most studies in the literature
considered anecdotes that involve an example with negative consequences (a
<em>negative</em> anecdote). For instance, a medication that does not treat the
symptoms of an illness. However, there is not much work in the literature that
involves an anecdote with positive consequences (a <em>positive</em> anecdote).
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> found an asymmetry in the effect of the anecdote, such that the
effect was stronger when a person in a description did not get better after a
medication (negative), compared to when they did get better (positive). The
present experiments found a more symmetrical effect, such that both the effects
of the moderated anecdotal bias and the influence of statistics were found in
both valence conditions.</p>
<p>The difference between the findings from this chapter and those from
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> might be due to the negative anecdote in their experiment
representing a persistence in a negative shift from the status quo (of not being
sick). In the business domain, both the positive and negative anecdotes
represent shifts from the status quo (of the company’s financial position).
Regardless, it is still surprising not to find an asymmetry because of the
predictions of prospect theory. Loss aversion suggests that participants would
have avoided the projects associated with the negative anecdotes more than they
would have chosen those associated with the positive anecdotes. On the other
hand, each choice was associated with the conflicting statistical information,
so this may cancel out the change from the reference point. Future research
should use more realistic incentives in order to investigate this effect
further. Doing this will also increase the ecological validity of the rest of
the findings.</p>

</h3>
<p>This chapter adds to the current understanding of the way people use different
forms of evidence in their decision-making. Previous work mostly investigated
the relative influence of statistics and anecdotes by comparing anecdote and
statistics conditions. The current work shows that comparing a joint anecdote &amp;
statistics condition to both an anecdote only and statistics only condition
allows for a more specific representation of participants’ anecdotal bias. The
influence of anecdote can be seen in the comparison between statistics only and
the anecdote &amp; statistics condition, but the effect of statistics can be seen in
the comparison between the combined condition and the anecdote only condition.
These two effects allow to determine the independent influence of anecdote and
statistics, respectively. Further use of such a design in future research might
help to further understand the conditions under which these types of evidence
are used.</p>
<p>It seems that in some of the anecdotal bias literature there is an assumption
that using anecdotal evidence over statistical evidence is necessarily
irrational. This likely arises from examples from the medical domain in which
such decisions are indeed irrational (e.g., believing that vaccines cause
certain disorders despite the available evidence). In such cases, people
over-rely on anecdotes and should be relying more on aggregated data. However, a
case could be made for a rational use of anecdote based on the similarity of the
anecdote to the target. For instance, there are times in which an anecdote is so
similar to the target situation (e.g., the identical twin example discussed in
Section <a href="anecdotes.html#effect-of-similarity">6.1.3</a>) that it would be unwise not to consider the
anecdote. That is, the use of anecdote should depend on both 1. the extent of
underlying structural similarity between it and the target problem, and 2. the
distribution of this similarity across cases in the sample from which the
anecdote was sampled. People should use an anecdote when casual structure is
significantly more relevant than other cases in available data.</p>
<p>However, similarity can also be misleading. For instance, if a case is highly
similar, but not along some key hidden dimension that is the real causal
mechanism to care about, then using the anecdote may be the wrong thing to do.
What seems to be important is a sensitivity to relational, rather than surface
level similarity. Future research should further investigate how varying the
assumptions that people have about sampling from a data set of anecdotes
influences their anecdotal bias. Such assumptions can include the size of the
sample, the shape of the distribution, and where in the distribution the
anecdote came from. Prior work found that people are sensitive to distributional
properties when generalizing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-carvalho2021" role="doc-biblioref">Carvalho et al., 2021</a>)</span>, but it is not clear if this will
replicate with descriptive cues such as in the experiments in this chapter.</p>

</h3>
<p>The current work can contribute to managerial decision making by suggesting
insights into how managers make better decisions when using case studies and
statistical information. Managers of large companies are often in a difficult
position; they have incomplete information and an uncertain environment. Despite
this, different biases and responses to those biases can be anticipated for
different levels of uncertainty. For instance, a manager may be presented with
both a convincing case study that suggests a certain course of action, and
aggregated data. The manager needs to be able to weigh the evidence accordingly.</p>
<p>The work in this chapter suggests that there are three elements to consider: 1.
the quality of the aggregated data (determined by factors such as the sample
size), 2. the relative similarity of the cases in the data pool to the target
situation, and 3. the similarity of the anecdote to the target. For instance, if
the anecdote is relevantly similar to the target situation, and it is
significantly more similar than the rest of the cases in the data set, then it
should have more weight than an anecdote that comes from a pool of cases that
are all equally similar to the target. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lovallo2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-lovallo2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> found that similarity
judgements increase prediction accuracy beyond a simple regression model. Taking
into account the relative similarity to other cases is likely to further
increase predictive validity.</p>
<p>In a situation in which aggregated data are not available, however, managers
should rely more on anecdotes that are more similar in causal structure. That
is, they should be wary of merely using the surface similarity to make
inferences, and instead consider the underlying relational structures. The
present data suggest that laypeople can do this to an extent, with participants
not being completely swayed by the mere similarity of the type of business
project. However, future research should investigate this further to better
understand the boundaries of people’s analogical reasoning in capital allocation
decisions.</p>
