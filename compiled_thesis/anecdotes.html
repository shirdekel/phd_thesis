</h2>
<p>A good story is often more persuasive than data. While usually harmless in daily
settings, poor judgement arising from a bias towards anecdotal evidence can lead
to large-scale negative consequences. Perhaps the most prominent example of such
an error in judgement is the belief that a vaccine causes a certain disorder
based on isolated stories, despite contradictory scientific evidence. An
analogous error exists in settings such as managerial decision-making. In
business, managers use analogies, known as <em>case studies</em>, as a part of their
strategic decision-making. Case studies are examples of previous situations
considered similar by the decision-maker and are used to draw inferences about a
target problem. Case studies are known as <em>anecdotes</em> when comparing them with
aggregated data.</p>
<p>Many businesses use case studies to inform their decisions but often struggle to
use them successfully <span class="citation">(Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, <a href="#ref-gavetti2005a" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. This may be attributable to the
prominence of companies that are either highly successful or highly
unsuccessful. That is, people are often uninterested in average outcomes but are
captivated by both positive and negative extreme outcomes. The increased
salience of an anecdote may increase its influence over that of useful
statistical data. Further, increased anecdotal salience may also shift attention
away from structural similarities in favour of more surface similarities. Both
of these issues may explain the unsuccessful use of case studies.</p>
<p>The first consideration when using a case study is its merit relative to
available aggregated statistical data. That is, if the case study is a single
data point in a set of other relevant cases, then using the statistical
properties of the larger sample is more inferentially informative than using a
single case from within the sample (unlike perhaps when the single case is
somehow the most relevant example from the sample). Despite the utility and
availability of large sample data, research has shown that people often prefer
anecdotal evidence over statistical data <span class="citation">(Freling et al., <a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>; Jaramillo et al., <a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Reinard, <a href="#ref-reinard1988" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>; Shen et al., <a href="#ref-shen2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, if this larger sample is not available (or is ignored), then the second
consideration when using a case study is the extent of its similarity to the
target problem. Research on the psychology of similarity judgements
distinguishes between surface and relational similarity <span class="citation">(Gentner, <a href="#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span>. The
consensus of this research is that the more conceptual structures that two cases
share, the more useful they are in decision-making <span class="citation">(Lassaline, <a href="#ref-lassaline1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>; Markman &amp; Medin, <a href="#ref-markman1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>. Therefore, case studies that are similar to a target problem on
a merely surface level are less useful than those that are related through a
shared conceptual structure.</p>
<p>Previous research has considered the role of similarity and analogical reasoning
in business-related decision-making <span class="citation">(e.g., Gavetti et al., <a href="#ref-gavetti2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. Others have
investigated the influence of anecdotes in capital allocation decisions and the
impact of anecdote similarity on their persuasiveness (summarised below).
However, it is unclear to what extent an anecdote’s similarity to the target
problem will affect its influence on capital allocation decisions. Further, it
is unclear whether people will be sensitive to information about the
distribution from which the anecdote was sampled.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Anecdotal Bias<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#anecdotal-bias"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Anecdotal bias refers to the influence of anecdotal evidence over statistical
evidence on people’s beliefs. Journalists, for instance, are well aware of the
power of anecdotes. An analysis of approximately 29,000 New York Times
editorials showed a reliance on anecdotes to drive arguments <span class="citation">(Al Khatib et al., <a href="#ref-alkhatib2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.
While some studies have concluded that statistics are more persuasive than
anecdotes <span class="citation">(e.g., Allen &amp; Preiss, <a href="#ref-allen1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>; Hoeken, <a href="#ref-hoeken2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>; Hornikx, <a href="#ref-hornikx2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> and others provided more
cautious conclusions <span class="citation">(Winterbottom et al., <a href="#ref-winterbottom2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, a number have found evidence for
anecdotal bias <span class="citation">(e.g., Reinard, <a href="#ref-reinard1988" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>; Jaramillo et al., <a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Ratcliff &amp; Sun, <a href="#ref-ratcliff2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>; Reinhart, <a href="#ref-reinhart2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Shen et al., <a href="#ref-shen2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Zebregs et al. (<a href="#ref-zebregs2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> suggest that this disparity in findings might be
attributable to statistics affecting beliefs and attitudes, and anecdotes
affecting intention. A more recent meta-analysis of 61 studies found that,
overall, statistical evidence is more persuasive than anecdotal evidence
<span class="citation">(Freling et al., <a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. However, even if statistical evidence is more persuasive
overall, anecdotes that add no additional information to co-presented statistics
may still influence people’s judgement <span class="citation">(Jaramillo et al., <a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. Further, the
meta-analysis found that people tend to prefer anecdotal evidence over
statistical data when the stakes are more emotional, medical, or relevant to the
decision-maker. In business, decisions are clearly relevant to the
decision-maker.</p>

</h3>
<p>It is important to investigate anecdotal bias in business because of its
implications for managers’ use of case studies. There are many cases of managers
successfully using analogies from anecdotal cases but also of failures to
analogise correctly <span class="citation">(Gavetti et al., <a href="#ref-gavetti2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>; Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, <a href="#ref-gavetti2005a" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. There is very little research
on anecdotal bias in business, but the existing work finds clear evidence of the
effect. In fact, the recent meta-analysis by <span class="citation">Freling et al. (<a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> included the work of
<span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> as one such paper.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> gave a sample of managers and other professionals a choice between
two audit firms, which varied in terms of their audit deficiencies for various
clients. The experiment was designed in such a way that the statistical evidence
favoured one firm, while the anecdotal evidence favoured the other firm.
Participants were allocated to one of five conditions. Participants in the
<em>anecdotes only</em> condition were given anecdotal examples of firm deficiencies,
while those in the <em>anecdotes &amp; statistics</em> condition were given the same
anecdotal examples as well as the number of clients and deficiencies found.
However, participants were not explicitly provided with the proportions of these
values. Participants in the <em>statistics only</em> condition were given this
proportions information as well as the number of clients without deficiencies
but no detailed examples of deficiencies. The <em>anecdotes &amp; enhanced statistics</em>
condition included both anecdotes and the information in the statistics only
condition. The terminology here is confusing because nothing about the way the
statistics are presented to the participants is “enhanced” beyond how they are
presented in the statistics only condition. However, the <em>anecdotes &amp; enhanced
statistics—judgment orientation</em> condition emphasised the importance of
proportions and keeping absolute numbers in context.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> measured the percentage of participants who chose firms favoured
by the statistical data, finding evidence of anecdotal bias. Participants in the
anecdotes only and anecdotes &amp; statistics conditions equally chose the firm
favoured by statistical data. However, participants in the anecdotes &amp; enhanced
statistics condition were less likely to choose this firm compared with those in
the statistics only condition, even when the underlying proportions were made
explicit. This shows evidence of anecdotal bias because participants ignored
contradictory statistical data. The lack of difference between the anecdotes &amp;
statistics condition and the anecdotes only condition implies that the anecdotal
bias effect was “complete”. That is, the presented statistics did not play a
role in influencing participants’ choice of firm. A “partial” effect would have
occurred if more participants in the anecdotes &amp; statistics condition had chosen
the firm compared with participants in the anecdotes only condition. This would
have meant that statistics played at least some role in influencing choice.</p>
<p>The other important finding in this work is that anecdotal bias was reduced by
highlighting relevant statistical features and providing an explanation of
statistical inference. This is important because it suggests that potential
psychological biases can be reduced with a reframing of provided information and
an explanation of relevant statistical concepts.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Wainberg (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> conducted a similar study to that of <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> but with a
capital budgeting task as opposed to a binary choice. Participants had to choose
between three production line machines for a mid-sized company that prints
circuit boards. The statistical data suggested that Machine A was better than
Machine B, and Machine B was better than Machine C. Participants were given only
statistical information or statistical information along with an anecdote. The
anecdote was in the form of an email from a colleague who recommended against
Machine A (the best option). Similar to <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, participants were
assigned to <em>anecdote &amp; statistics</em> and <em>statistics only</em> conditions. In the
<em>judgement orientation I</em> and <em>judgement orientation II</em> conditions,
participants were told to “think like a scientist” and received either a short
or a long explanation, respectively, of the importance of statistical inference.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Wainberg (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> found evidence for anecdotal bias. Including a contradictory
anecdote alongside statistical evidence (the anecdote &amp; statistics condition)
reduced the proportion of participants who chose Machine A. The study also found
that the addition of instructions that emphasised scientific thinking reduced
this bias. Unlike <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Wainberg (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> could not determine whether the
anecdotal bias was a complete or partial because there was no anecdote only
condition. Further, neither work considered the effect of the anecdote’s
similarity to the target problem.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Effect of Similarity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#effect-of-similarity"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Arguably, the extent of one’s reliance on an anecdote should depend on its
similarity to the target problem. Previous work has examined the importance of
weighting previous cases according to their similarity to the present situation
<span class="citation">(Gilboa &amp; Schmeidler, <a href="#ref-gilboa1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>; Lovallo et al., <a href="#ref-lovallo2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. For instance, consider a medical treatment with
contradictory statistical and anecdotal evidence; that is, a large-scale
aggregated study has found that the treatment has 99% efficacy, while someone
reports on social media that they became sick as a side-effect of the treatment.
While the decision to use the treatment should be informed more by the
aggregated data than by the anecdotal data, an individual may have reason to be
concerned if the person who became sick was their identical twin. Therefore, the
inference that the individual may also need to be cautious about the treatment
arises from a specific causal model based on the shared genetics of the two
cases.</p>
<p>There have been mixed results regarding the effect of anecdote similarity on the
extent of anecdotal bias. <span class="citation">Hoeken and Hustinx (<a href="#ref-hoeken2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a> Study 3)</span> found evidence for the effect of
similarity on anecdotal bias for a variety of claims. As well as manipulating
whether participants received a claim supported by anecdotal or statistical
evidence, they manipulated whether the anecdotal evidence was similar or
dissimilar to the claim that it was supporting. They found that similar
anecdotes were more persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes. Using a student
sample, <span class="citation">Hoeken (<a href="#ref-hoeken2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> did not find evidence for the effect of similarity to a
local government proposal. Similarly, <span class="citation">Hornikx (<a href="#ref-hornikx2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> considered the effect of
similarity on anecdotal bias in local government policy decision-making. The
researchers did not find an effect for similarity or for anecdotes. However,
they measured persuasiveness, and it may be that requiring participants to make
more concrete decisions will create a more realistic scenario.</p>
<p>Apart from the need to determine the effect of similarity on the anecdotal bias
effect, it is important to clarify how such an effect might work. Research on
analogical reasoning has distinguished between simple surface similarity and
deeper relational similarity <span class="citation">(Gentner, <a href="#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span>. As mentioned above, one’s use of an
anecdote should depend on the extent to which it is associated by an underlying
causal mechanism or mere surface similarity. Imagine a manager of a
multi-divisional company deciding on the allocation of capital between an oil
well project and a technology project. Would hearing of a recent failed oil well
project at another company influence the manager’s allocation decision? If so,
would it influence the manager’s decision because the anecdote has similarities
to the target oil well project (surface similarity)? Or would the manager seek
out the underlying reason for the failure of the other company’s oil well
project to identify whether it is relevant to the target oil project (relational
similarity)? The experiments presented in this chapter investigated whether the
anecdotal bias effect arose from causal inductive reasoning or merely the
surface similarity with the target project.</p>

</h3>
<p>Experiment 1 investigated whether anecdotal bias in a capital allocation
paradigm depends on anecdote similarity. Further, it tested whether providing
additional statistical information encourages participants to consider the
statistics over the anecdote. Experiment 1 used a negative anecdote, which is an
example of an unsuccessful case. This kind of anecdote has been shown to produce
anecdotal bias in both medical <span class="citation">(Jaramillo et al., <a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> and business <span class="citation">(Wainberg, <a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>
decision-making. However, <span class="citation">Jaramillo et al. (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> found less bias in positive anecdotes,
which are examples of successful cases, and <span class="citation">Wainberg (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> did not consider these
at all. Therefore, Experiment 2 attempted to replicate the effect of similarity
on anecdotal bias using a positive anecdote. Further, Experiment 2 provided
participants with information about the sample distribution of the anecdote,
whereas Experiment 1 did not. This allowed for an informal test of whether
people are sensitive to such information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Experiment 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#anecdotes-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 1 investigated the effects of anecdote similarity and bias on
capital allocation. Participants were assigned to the same conditions as those
in <span class="citation">Wainberg (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> except that an anecdote only condition was included and the
judgement orientation I condition was excluded. They were then asked to allocate
a hypothetical budget between two business projects. Participants were also
presented with a case study that was either similar or dissimilar to the target
project (but still from the same industry). Further, for the conditions in which
statistical evidence was provided, participants were presented with aggregated
information about the success of similar projects in the form of NPV as well as
a reliability measure. One project was clearly better than the other in terms of
the statistical data, but the anecdotal evidence suggested the opposite.</p>
<p>Previous research has found that people are persuaded more by negative anecdotes
than by positive statistical data in capital allocation scenarios
<span class="citation">(Wainberg, <a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. While studies have shown that similar anecdotes are more
persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes <span class="citation">(Hoeken &amp; Hustinx, <a href="#ref-hoeken2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Study 3)</span>, it is unclear how
the anecdotal bias effect may depend on anecdote similarity. Thus, the main
question is whether anecdotal bias will be greater when the anecdote is similar
to the target project compared with when it is dissimilar. The target project
was supported by the statistics but was inconsistent with the anecdotes.
Further, Experiment 1 only used negative anecdotes. Therefore, the experiment
would show evidence of anecdotal bias if participants assigned to the statistics
only condition allocated more money to the target project compared with those in
the anecdote &amp; statistics condition. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the
following hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.1  (anecdotal bias depends on the similarity of negative anecdotes)  </strong></span>Budget allocations to the target project will be higher when statistics only are
presented compared with when statistics are accompanied by an anecdote with high
similarity to the target project. In addition, budget allocations will not be
affected by anecdotes with low similarity. That is, the statistics only
condition will not differ from the low-similarity anecdote &amp; statistics
condition.
</div>
<p>Experiment 1 predicted that that the anecdotal bias effect will be complete, as
in <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Specifically, the participants presented with the
high-similarity anecdote along with the statistics would not use any statistical
information. Testing the high similarity condition will provide an equivalent
test to that of <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.2  (effect of statistics for negative anecdotes)  </strong></span>Participants in the high-similarity anecdote &amp; statistics condition (without the
enhanced statistics explanation) and those in the high-similarity anecdote only
condition will allocate capital equally to the target project.
</div>
<p>Participants with additional information on the importance of scientific
thinking and statistical data may be less affected by anecdotes. <span class="citation">Wainberg (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>
termed this the <em>judgement orientation II</em> condition, while in this experiment
it is termed the <em>anecdote &amp; enhanced statistics condition</em>. Unlike the anecdote
&amp; enhanced statistics condition in <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, the statistical information
here is actually “enhanced” because of the accompanying text. Experiment 1
tested whether the effect of additional information on anecdotal bias would be
replicated in a capital allocation scenario. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the

<p>Two hundred and eighty-four participants (197 female) were recruited from a cohort of psychology undergraduates at The University of Sydney. Participants were compensated with course credit. The average age was 20.84 years (<em>SD</em> = 4.93, <em>min.</em> = 18, <em>max.</em> = 58). Participants reported an average of 1.68 years (<em>SD</em> = 3.63, <em>min.</em> = 0, <em>max.</em> = 32) working in a business setting, and an average of 0.81 years (<em>SD</em> = 1.57, <em>min.</em> = 0, <em>max.</em> = 12) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 22.24 min (<em>SD</em> = 97.45, <em>min.</em> = 1.67, <em>max.</em> = 1,101.48). Table <a href="anecdotes.html#tab:condition-allocation-anecdotes-1">6.1</a>

<p>In the allocation task, participants were asked to allocate a hypothetical
budget to one of two projects from two different businesses. In this chapter,
these projects are referred to as the <em>focal</em> projects, with one being the
<em>target</em> project and the other the <em>comparison</em> project. The target project was
used as the reference for the similarity manipulation. That is, the anecdote was
either high or low in similarity to the target project. Further, the data
analyses presented in Section <a href="anecdotes.html#results-anecdotes-1">6.2.2</a> used allocations to the
target project as the dependent variable. The comparison project was simply the
other focal project to which participants were allocating. It was always a
different type of project to both the target and anecdote projects.</p>
<p>Participants were presented with information about the name, location,
integration (vertical or horizontal), and organisational structure (centralised
or decentralised) of each business (see
Appendix <a href="anecdotes-appendix.html#allocation-materials-anecdotes-1">C.1.1.2.2</a> for an explanation of these
terms). Further, they were presented with information about the features of each
project that are typically available to managers prior to investment.
Participants in the anecdote only condition were shown only this information
(see Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:project-allocation-anecdote-only-materials-anecdotes-1">6.1</a>).
Those in the anecdote &amp; statistics, anecdote &amp; enhanced statistics, and
statistics only conditions were shown this information along with measures of
NPV and overall reliability rating (see
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:project-allocation-statistics-materials-anecdotes-1">6.2</a>).
Participants entered their allocation data beneath this table in two text boxes
labelled <em>Project A allocation</em> and <em>Project B allocation</em>, respectively.</p>

<p>Participants who were presented with an anecdote (those in either the anecdote
only, anecdote &amp; statistics, or anecdote &amp; enhanced statistics conditions) were
shown a description of another business project and an accompanying analysis.
Figures <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:anecdote-similarity-high-materials-anecdotes-1">6.3</a>
and <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:anecdote-similarity-low-materials-anecdotes-1">6.4</a> show the anecdotes
for those in the high and low similarity conditions, respectively. The project
description had a similar layout to that of the focal projects. That is, it
contained information about the business name, location, integration, and
organisational structure of the business. It also detailed several predicted
features of the project. Beneath this description was a paragraph presenting an
analysis of why the project had failed. This paragraph referenced each of the
features in the description to justify the failure of the project.</p>
<p>Participants in the high similarity condition were shown a description of a
project from a business with the same type of investment as the target project
(Project A). All categorical attributes were identical to those in Project A,
but all numerical attributes were lower. The analysis explained that the
numerical attributes had failed because they had not reached certain cut-offs.
Critically, these cut-offs were all higher than the matching values in
Project A. This was done to ensure that the numerical attributes in the anecdote
appeared more relevant than those in Project A. For instance, in Project A, oil
extraction was set at 2,200 L/hr, and in the anecdote it was 2,000 L/hr, while
the cut-off was set at 3,000 L/hr. Thus, the failure of the anecdotal project
arising from insufficient oil extraction would appear more relevant because the
oil extraction in both the anecdotal project and Project A was lower than the
cut-off value. Note, however, that there was uncertainty about the
generalisability of these cut-off values because the participants did not
receive an explicit indication of whether these values were meant to generalise
to other cases.</p>

<p>Anecdotal bias was tested by comparing the statistics only condition with both
the high- and low-similarity anecdote and statistics conditions (see

participants in the statistics only condition allocated a higher percentage of
their budget to the target project compared with participants in the
high-similarity anecdote with statistics condition,

<p>The effect of enhanced statistics was investigated by testing the interaction of
anecdote similarity and evidence type (anecdote &amp; statistics and anecdote &amp;
enhanced statistics conditions, excluding the anecdote only and statistics only
conditions). As shown in

Further, the difference between the anecdote &amp; statistics condition and the
anecdote &amp; enhanced statistics condition (averaged over similarity conditions)
was also not significant, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -0.12\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-6.50,~6.26]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(238) = -0.04\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .971\)</span>.
This suggests that providing participants with information about how to think
statistically is not sufficient to facilitate a focus on statistics.</p>

<p>To identify the influence of statistics on participants’ allocations, a two-way

(see Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-1-allocation">6.6</a>). The interaction between

Specifically, the difference in allocations between the anecdote only condition

that specific relevance ratings were related to allocations, but only in the

simply reacting to the failed project and associating that with that project’s

</h3>
<p>Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1">6.1</a> was supported.
Participants in the anecdote &amp; statistics condition allocated less capital to
the target project compared with those in the statistics only condition.
However, this effect depended on anecdote similarity because this only occurred
in the high similarity condition, not in the low similarity condition. Thus,
while anecdotal bias was evident when the anecdote was similar to the target
project, participants were not influenced when the causal mechanisms did not
align. Contrary to Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1">6.2</a>, despite being
influenced by the anecdote, participants still made some use of the statistics.
This is different from the findings of <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, who found no difference
between the anecdote only and anecdote and statistics conditions, indicating a
complete anecdotal bias effect.
Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1">6.3</a> was also not supported
because the added enhanced statistical instructions used to encourage
participants to use the statistical information did not reduce participants’
reliance on anecdotes.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 was limited because it only considered a <em>negative</em> anecdote; that
is, a failed project. In real life, however, case studies often have a
<em>positive</em> valence; that is, the story of a successful company. In fact, in
business, it is possible that the anecdotes used are more likely to be positive
because of survivorship bias. <span class="citation">Jaramillo et al. (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> found an anecdotal bias effect for
negative but not positive anecdotes. This may be because the stimuli consisted
of medical decisions and, in this domain, the loss of health may be more
strongly noted than an equivalent gain in health. In Experiment 2 (discussed in
the subsequent section) a positive anecdote was added to investigate whether
anecdote valence would affect anecdotal bias.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the effects found in Experiment 1 were related to
participants’ perceptions of the type of sampling used to select the anecdotes.
The instructions in Experiment 1 did not explain how the anecdote displayed to
participants was chosen. Whether sampling is believed to be intentional or
random has been shown to affect people’s decision-making <span class="citation">(e.g., Hayes et al., <a href="#ref-hayes2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. In
the present experiments, participants’ sampling assumptions may have changed the
extent to which they used the anecdote in their decisions. For example, it may
be rational to choose the anecdote over the aggregated data if (a) the anecdote
was not sampled randomly from a pool of anecdotes, and (b) the anecdote had a
greater similarity to the target project compared with other anecdotes in the
pool in relevant ways. That is, if the anecdote were chosen because of its high
relevance to the target project, it would be irrational to ignore it. In
Experiment 1, it was unclear whether participants may have held these beliefs.
To control for these assumptions, in Experiment 2, the instructions further
clarified that the anecdote (a) was sampled randomly from a pool of anecdotes,
and (b) was not significantly more similar to the target project than any of the
other anecdotes in the pool.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Experiment 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#anecdotes-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Experiment 1 replicated the anecdotal bias effect found in the literature. That
is, participants allocated less capital to a project when presented with an
anecdote and conflicting statistics compared with when they were presented with
the statistics only. However, this effect depended on anecdote similarity, such
that anecdotal bias was stronger when the anecdote was similar to the current
task compared with when it was dissimilar. A negative anecdote only was used
Experiment 1 because previous research has found anecdotal bias for negative but
not for positive anecdotes <span class="citation">(Jaramillo et al., <a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. However, <span class="citation">Jaramillo et al. (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>
investigated medical decision-making, and the effect of anecdote valence may be
different in a business context. In the study by <span class="citation">Jaramillo et al. (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, the positive
anecdote involved a treatment that led to a reduction in symptoms, while the
negative anecdote involved symptoms persisting. This framing may have led
participants to perceive the positive anecdote as a return to a reference point
and the negative anecdote as a continuation of a reduction in wellbeing relative
to the reference point. In business, however, both successful and failed
business projects represent a deviation from a reference point. To test this
difference further, manipulation of anecdote valence was added to Experiment 2.</p>
<p>To increase the experiment’s power, anecdote valence and anecdote similarity
were manipulated within subjects. Further, Experiment 2 did not include the
anecdote &amp; enhanced statistics condition because Experiment 1 found no
evidence for its effect. All participants saw the statistics only condition,
which did not contain an anecdote; therefore, this did not need to be
manipulated between subjects. Therefore, each participant was shown five
displays: one for the statistics only condition, and four for either the
anecdote only condition or the anecdote &amp; statistics condition. These four
anecdote displays consisted of the similarity (low and high) <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> valence
(negative and positive) conditions.</p>
<p>In Experiment 1, assumptions about the pool from which the anecdote was sampled
were not clarified. In Experiment 2, participants were told that the anecdote
was sampled randomly and that it was not uniquely similar to the target project.
This was expected to lead to a reliance on statistical evidence, regardless of
the anecdote’s similarity. However, people often struggle to use statistical
concepts presented descriptively, as seen in the enhanced statistics condition
in Experiment 1, the neglect of variance shown in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, and
the lack of risk aggregation in descriptive risky decisions shown in
Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a>. Therefore, it was expected that the results of
Experiment 1 would be replicated for the negative valence condition. Further, it
was expected that there would be a reverse effect in the positive valence
condition. Appendix <a href="anecdotes-appendix.html#anecdotes-2-appendix">C.2</a> shows a simulation of the
hypothesised effects. Therefore, Experiment 2 tested the following hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:three-way-anecdotes-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.4  (overall effect)  </strong></span>The three-way similarity <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> valence <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> anecdote (excluding
statistics only) interaction is significant
</div>
<p>The main effect of interest was the effect of anecdote similarity on anecdotal
bias. However, because in Experiment 2 all participants were presented with the
statistics only condition, a difference score was calculated to simplify the
analyses. Specifically, this was the difference between the allocation in the
anecdote &amp; statistics conditions and the relevant allocation in the statistics
only condition. A score that is different from zero indicates deviation from the
allocation when only statistics were shown. For positive valence, a stronger
influence of anecdote is indicated by a lower difference score; whereas for
negative valence, a stronger influence of anecdote is indicated by a higher
difference score. Therefore, Experiment 2 tested the following hypotheses:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:anecdote-similarity-negative-anecdotes-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.5  (anecdotal bias difference score for negative anecdotes)  </strong></span>For negative anecdotes, the difference between budget allocations to the target
project in the statistics only condition and the anecdote &amp; statistics condition
will be higher when the anecdote is similar to the target project compared with
when it is dissimilar.
</div>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:anecdote-similarity-positive-anecdotes-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.6  (anecdotal bias difference score for positive anecdotes)  </strong></span>For positive anecdotes, the difference between budget allocations to the target

<p>Contrary to both <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1">6.2</a>,

<p>Ninety-six participants (50 female) were recruited from the online recruitment platform Prolific. Participants were compensated at a rate of 5 an hour (Prolific is based in the UK). The average age was 41.69 years (<em>SD</em> = 11.29, <em>min.</em> = 27, <em>max.</em> = 74). Participants reported an average of 7.19 years (<em>SD</em> = 8.34, <em>min.</em> = 0, <em>max.</em> = 43) working in a business setting, and an average of 3.91 years (<em>SD</em> = 7.67, <em>min.</em> = 0, <em>max.</em> = 50) of business education. The mean completion time of the task was 14.98 min (<em>SD</em> = 8.84, <em>min.</em> = 2.57, <em>max.</em> = 58.71). Table <a href="anecdotes.html#tab:condition-allocation-anecdotes-2">6.2</a>
shows the allocation of participants to the different conditions. Anecdote
similarity and valence were manipulated within subjects. Therefore, each
participant was assigned to one of two between-subjects evidence type conditions
(anecdote only and anecdote &amp; statistics) and saw five displays (statistics
only, and one of each of the four similarity and valence conditions).

</h4>
<p>To investigate whether anecdotal bias depended on anecdote similarity, the
differences in budget allocations between the statistics only condition and the
two anecdote &amp; statistics conditions (high and low similarity) were calculated.
The values of the statistics only condition were different for each valence
condition to create equivalent comparisons. For the negative valence condition,
participants allocated more money the high-NPV project; while for the positive
valence condition, participants allocated more money to the low-NPV project. As
shown in Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference">6.13</a>, the
similarity <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> valence interaction was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(1, 47) = 30.66\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .395\)</span>, as was the
main effect of valence, <span class="math inline">\(F(1, 47) = 9.85\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .003\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .173\)</span>.
The main effect of similarity was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(1, 47) = 0.53\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .469\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .011\)</span>.</p>
<p>The effect of the anecdote is represented differently for each valence
condition. As such, the interaction was further analysed by comparing the two
similarity conditions for each valence condition. For negative anecdotes, the
statistical values (e.g., NPV) associated with the target project were higher
than those for the comparison project. If participants were influenced by the
negative anecdote they would therefore allocate less to the target. For negative
anecdotes, a lower allocation to the target project is represented in
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference">6.13</a> as a positive
value—the difference in allocation from when the participant did not see an
anecdote. For positive anecdotes, the statistics were lower for the target
project, so an influence of the anecdote is seen as a negative value in
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation-difference">6.13</a>. The hypothesised
effect of negative anecdote similarity on anecdotal bias would suggest a higher
difference score in high similarity than in low similarity. That is, more
influence of the anecdote when it is similar than when it is dissimilar. For
positive anecdotes a the hypothesised effect would suggest the reverse: a higher
difference score in low similarity than in high similarity.</p>
<p>For negative anecdotes, the allocation difference was greater when the anecdote
was similar to the target project than when it was dissimilar,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -18.17\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-26.17,~-10.17]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(93.80) = -4.51\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>. For positive
anecdotes, the allocation difference was greater when the anecdote was
dissimilar to the target project than when it was similar,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 14.10\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([6.10,~22.11]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(93.80) = 3.50\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>. This provides
evidence that anecdotal bias depends on anecdote similarity for both negative
and positive anecdotes. Participants appeared to be sensitive to the relevance
of the anecdote to the target problem.</p>

<p>As in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 investigated the extent to which statistical

Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-2-allocation">6.12</a>, for negative anecdotes,
participants in the high-similarity anecdote &amp; statistics condition allocated
more to the target project than those in the high-similarity anecdote only

allocations and the follow-up relevance ratings.
Figure <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:plot-anecdotes-2-lm-allocation-relevance-specific-similarity">6.14</a>
shows these data. While the specific relevance ratings for negative anecdotes
showed the same trends as in Experiment 1, the interaction was not significant.
Similarly, the ratings trends for positive anecdotes were as hypothesised, but
their interaction not significant. It appears that specific relevance ratings
were related to allocations, but only in the high similarity condition. Further,
there were no significant associations with the general relevance ratings. This
provides limited evidence that people were explicitly reasoning about the
connection between the anecdote and target.</p>

and <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-positive-anecdotes-2">6.6</a> were supported because
participants showed a stronger anecdotal bias effect when both positive and

Hypotheses <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-negative-anecdotes-2">6.7</a>
and <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-positive-anecdotes-2">6.8</a>, participants incorporated
statistical information in their judgements, for both negative and positive
anecdotes. Unlike in Experiment 1, the relevance rating data did not provide as
clear indication that participants were using only the specific project
information rather than merely its industry.</p>
<p>Therefore, Experiment 2 found that, unlike in the medical domain, the effect of
anecdotes in financial decision-making does not depend on anecdote valence.
Further, similar to the findings of Experiment 1, and unlike those of
<span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, the anecdotal bias effect does not appear to be complete, with
statistics still playing some role in participants’ decisions, despite the

<span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> General Discussion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#general-discussion-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Most of the hypotheses were supported. This chapter found that, in the capital
allocation context, people’s decisions are influenced by anecdotes, even when
aggregated data are available. There were three novel findings: (a) the
anecdotal bias effect was only seen when participants considered the anecdote
sufficiently relevant to the target project, (b) participants integrated
statistics into their decisions, and (c) these effects were found in both
negative and positive anecdotes. Further, people did not consider verbal sample
distribution information, which could have helped to inform their decisions.
This is surprising since other work showed that generalisations are sensitive to
sampling <span class="citation">(Carvalho et al., <a href="#ref-carvalho2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The first novel finding from these experiments is that participants’ use of
anecdotal evidence depended on the anecdote’s similarity. Specifically, if the
anecdote appeared relevant, participants used it in their decisions. However,
when it appeared irrelevant, participants almost entirely relied on statistics.
The findings for high anecdote similarity are largely congruent with findings
from other work investigating anecdotal bias in business decision-making. As in
<span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Wainberg (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, this chapter found that people allocated less
capital to a project when presented with statistical evidence and a similar but
contradictory anecdote than when they were presented with statistics alone.</p>
<p>It appears that participants distinguished between the low- and high-similarity
anecdotes based on the structure of the anecdote. The low similarity condition
always included the same project type as the high similarity condition for all
domains. For instance, in one variation, both the high- and low-similarity
anecdotes involved oil well projects. However, the high-similarity anecdotes
also matched the target project in a number of specific features. This means
that participants were sensitive to the specific information in the anecdote
description and analysis and did not simply use the project type for their
inferences. Further, participants’ answers to the follow-up questions indicated
that they did not consider that the anecdote was necessarily relevant to other
projects from the same industry. In other words, participants did not appear to
carelessly use anecdotal evidence in their decisions; rather, they carefully
considered the anecdote according to its particular causal structure.</p>
<p>The second novel finding from these experiments is that participants who were
shown the anecdote with statistics did not completely disregard the statistical
measures. <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> found a complete anecdotal bias effect because results
for the anecdote only and anecdote &amp; statistics conditions were equivalent,
meaning that the presented statistics had a negligible effect on participants’
decisions. In contrast, the experiments discussed in this chapter showed a
partial anecdotal bias effect, seen as a difference in allocations between the
anecdote only and anecdote &amp; statistics conditions. It appears that participants
integrated both anecdotal and statistical information. This suggests that
people’s evaluation of evidence may be more sensitive than previously thought.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between these results and those in <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> could be a
result of the sampled population. Since <span class="citation">Freling et al. (<a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> found that anecdotes had a
stronger effect when decisions were more personally relevant; thus, the managers
recruited for the <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> study may have simply been more personally
invested in the task compared with the laypeople recruited for the experiments
presented in this chapter. Similarly, <span class="citation">Yang et al. (<a href="#ref-yang2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> found that anxiety increases
anecdotal bias when making risky decisions. However, the discrepancy may also be
attributable to the difference in the anecdote &amp; statistics condition between
the <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> study and the present work. Specifically, the statistics
presented in the anecdote &amp; statistics condition in <span class="citation">Wainberg et al. (<a href="#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> were not the
same as those shown in the same study’s statistics only condition, unlike in
both the present experiments and <span class="citation">Wainberg (<a href="#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Instead, it was the anecdote &amp;
enhanced statistics condition that contained the same statistics as in the
statistics only condition. This suggests that people only integrate statistics
when they are sufficiently clear and no further interpretation is required.</p>
<p>The third novel finding from these experiments is that anecdotal bias was found
for both negative and positive anecdotes. Most previous studies have included
negative anecdotes (i.e. those with negative consequences) such as a medication
that fails to reduce symptoms. However, there is little work in the literature
involving positive anecdotes (those with positive consequences). <span class="citation">Jaramillo et al. (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>
found an asymmetry in the anecdote effect—the effect of the anecdote was
stronger when the medication failed to improve symptoms (negative anecdote)
compared with when it did improve symptoms (positive anecdote). The present
experiments found a more symmetrical effect—the effects of both anecdotal bias
and statistics were found for both negative and positive anecdotes.</p>
<p>The difference between the findings of this chapter and those of <span class="citation">Jaramillo et al. (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>
may be attributable to the latter’s negative anecdote representing a persistence
in a negative shift from the status quo (i.e. good health). In the business
domain, both positive and negative anecdotes represent shifts from the status
quo (a company’s financial position). Nevertheless, it was surprising to find no
asymmetry given the predictions of prospect theory. Loss aversion suggests that
participants will avoid projects that are similar to negative anecdotes more
than they will choose those similar to positive anecdotes. However, each choice
was associated with conflicting statistical information, so this may have
cancelled out the change from the reference point. Future research should use
more realistic incentives to investigate this effect further. Doing so will also
increase the ecological validity of the findings.</p>

</h3>
<p>The findings presented in this chapter add to the current understanding of the
way in which people use different types of evidence in their decision-making.
Previous research mostly investigated the relative influence of statistics and
anecdotes by comparing anecdotal with statistical conditions. The current work
shows that comparing a joint anecdote &amp; statistics condition with both an
anecdote only and statistics only condition enables a more specific
investigation of participants’ anecdotal bias. The influence of anecdotes can be
seen in the comparison of the statistics only and the anecdote &amp; statistics
conditions, while the effect of statistics can be seen in the comparison of the
anecdote &amp; statistics condition and the anecdote only condition. These two
effects enable the determination of the independent influences of anecdote &amp;
statistics. Use of such a design in future research may help to further the
understanding of conditions under which these types of evidence are used.</p>
<p>Some of the anecdotal bias literature is based on the assumption that using
anecdotal evidence over statistical evidence is necessarily irrational. This is
likely to have arisen from examples in the medical domain in which such
decisions are indeed irrational (e.g., believing that vaccines cause certain
disorders, despite the available evidence). In such cases, people over-rely on
anecdotes and should be relying more on aggregated data. However, a case could
be made for the rational use of an anecdote based on its similarity to the
target problem. For instance, there are times when an anecdote is so similar to
the target situation (e.g., the identical twin example discussed in
Section <a href="anecdotes.html#effect-of-similarity">6.1.3</a>) that it would be unwise not to consider it.
That is, the use of anecdote should depend on both (a) the extent of underlying
structural similarity to the target problem and (b) the distribution of this
similarity across the pool from which the anecdote was sampled. People should
use anecdotes if their casual structures are significantly more relevant
compared with other cases in the available data.</p>
<p>However, similarity can also be misleading. For instance, if a case appears
highly similar but differs in terms of a key hidden dimension that is the real
causal mechanism, then using the anecdote may be the wrong thing to do. What
appears to be important is being sensitive to relational rather than surface
similarity. Future research should investigate how varying participants’
assumptions about sampling from a data set of anecdotes influences their
anecdotal bias. Such assumptions can include the size of the sample, the shape
of the distribution, and where in the distribution the anecdote came from. Prior
work found that people are sensitive to distributional properties when
generalizing <span class="citation">(Carvalho et al., <a href="#ref-carvalho2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, but it is not clear if this will replicate with
descriptive cues such as in the experiments in this chapter.</p>

</h3>
<p>The current work contributes to managerial decision-making by providing insights
into how managers make better decisions when using case studies and statistical
information. Managers of large companies are often in a difficult position; they
have incomplete information and are in an uncertain environment. Despite this,
different biases and responses to those biases may be anticipated for different
levels of uncertainty. For instance, a manager may be presented with both a
convincing case study that suggests a certain course of action as well as
aggregated data. The manager needs to be able to weigh the evidence accordingly.</p>
<p>The work in this chapter suggests that there are three elements to consider: (a)
the quality of aggregated data (determined by factors such as sample size), (b)
the relative similarity of the cases in the data pool to the target situation,
and (c) the similarity of the anecdote to the target problem. For instance, an
anecdote that is similar to the target situation in terms of relevance and is
significantly more similar than other cases in the data set should carry more
weight than an anecdote that comes from a pool of cases that are all equally
similar to the target problem. <span class="citation">Lovallo et al. (<a href="#ref-lovallo2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> found that similarity judgements
increase prediction accuracy beyond a simple regression model. Taking into
account a project’s relative similarity to other cases is likely to further
increase predictive validity.</p>
<p>When aggregated data are not available, however, managers should rely more on
anecdotes that have greater similarities in terms of causal structure. That is,
they should be wary of merely using surface similarities to make inferences and
instead consider the underlying relational structures. The present data suggest
that laypeople can do this to some extent, with participants not being
completely swayed by the mere similarity of type of business project. However,
future research should investigate this further to better understand the
boundaries of people’s analogical reasoning in capital allocation decisions.</p>
