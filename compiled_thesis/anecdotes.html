<p>A good story is often more persuasive than data. While usually harmless in daily
settings, poor judgement due to a bias towards anecdotal evidence can lead to
larger-scale negative consequences. Perhaps the most prominent example of such
an error in judgement is belief that a vaccine causes a certain disorder based
on isolated stories, despite contradictory scientific evidence. An analogous
error exists in settings such as managerial decision-making. In business,
managers use analogies, usually called <em>case studies</em>, as a part of strategic
decision-making. Case studies are examples of previous situations that are
considered similar by the decision-maker and are used to draw inferences about a
target problem. When comparing such examples with aggregated data these are
called anecdotes.</p>
<p>Many businesses use case studies to inform their decisions, but often struggle
to use them successfully <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gavetti2005a" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, 2005</a>)</span>. This is likely because of the high
salience of companies that have ended up either very successful or very
unsuccessful. That is, people are often uninterested in average outcomes, but
are captivated by both positive or negative extreme outcomes. This has two
related impacts: increased salience of an anecdote may increase its influence
above statistical data and may shift attention away from structural similarities
in favour of more surface similarities. The extent to which statistical data is
consulted and the decision-maker’s judgement of the anecdote’s similarity are
two issues that may explain the unsuccessful use of case studies.</p>
<p>The first consideration when using a case study is its merit relative to
available aggregated statistical data. That is, if the case study is a single
data point in a set of other relevant cases, then using the statistical
properties of the larger sample is more inferentially informative than using a
single case from within the sample. Research has shown that people sometimes
prefer anecdotal evidence over statistical data <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>; e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-reinard1988" role="doc-biblioref">Reinard, 1988</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-shen2015" role="doc-biblioref">Shen et al., 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, if this larger sample is not available (or is ignored), then the second
consideration when using a case study is the extent of its similarity to the
target problem. Research on similarity distinguishes between surface and
relational similarity <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner, 1983</a>)</span>; the consensus of this research is that the
more conceptual structures two cases share, the more useful they are in
decision-making <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lassaline1996" role="doc-biblioref">Lassaline, 1996</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-markman1995" role="doc-biblioref">Arthur B. Markman &amp; Medin, 1995</a>)</span>. As such, case studies that are
similar to a target problem on a merely surface level are less useful than those
that are related by shared conceptual structure.</p>
<p>Previous research has considered the role of similarity and analogical reasoning
in business-related decision-making <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gavetti2005" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti et al., 2005</a>)</span>, but it is unclear to what
extent the similarity of a anecdote to the target will affect the strength of
the anecdotal bias.</p>

<p>Anecdotal bias is the finding that anecdotal evidence influences people’s
beliefs more than statistical evidence. Journalists are well aware of the power
of anecdotes. For example, an analysis of approximately 29,000 New York Times
editorials showing a reliance on anecdotes to drive arguments <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-alkhatib2017" role="doc-biblioref">Al Khatib et al., 2017</a>)</span>.
While some research concluded that statistics are more persuasive than anecdotes
<span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-allen1997" role="doc-biblioref">Allen &amp; Preiss, 1997</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-hoeken2001" role="doc-biblioref">Hoeken, 2001</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-hornikx2005" role="doc-biblioref">Hornikx, 2005</a>)</span> and others were equivocal
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-winterbottom2008" role="doc-biblioref">Winterbottom et al., 2008</a>)</span>, a number of studies have found evidence for anecdotal bias
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-ratcliff2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ratcliff &amp; Sun, 2020</a>; e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-reinard1988" role="doc-biblioref">Reinard, 1988</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-reinhart2006" role="doc-biblioref">Reinhart, 2006</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-shen2015" role="doc-biblioref">Shen et al., 2015</a>)</span>.

statistics having an effect on beliefs and attitudes, and anecdotes affecting
intention. A more recent meta-analysis of 61 studies showed that overall people
find statistical evidence more persuasive than anecdotal evidence
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">Freling et al., 2020</a>)</span>. However, even if statistical evidence is overall more persuasive
across studies, anecdotes than add no additional information to co-presented
statistics still influence judgement <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Further, the
meta-analysis found that people tend to prefer anecdotal evidence over
statistical data when the stakes are more emotional, medical, or relevant to the
decision-maker. In business, the decisions are clearly relevant to the
decision-maker.</p>

<p>It is important to investigate anecdotal bias in business because of the
implications this might have on managers’ use of case studies. There are many
cases of managers successfully using analogies from anecdotal cases, but also of
failures to analogise properly <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gavetti2005" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti et al., 2005</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-gavetti2005a" role="doc-biblioref">Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, 2005</a>)</span>. There is very
little research on anecdote bias in business, but the existing work finds clear
evidence of the effect. In fact, the recent meta-analysis by <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">Freling et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> only
included the work in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> as one such paper. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> gave a
sample of managers and other professionals a choice between two audit firms that
was based on their audit deficiencies for various clients. The experiment was
designed in a way that the statistical evidence favoured one firm and the
anecdotal evidence favoured the other firm. Participants either viewed an
<em>anecdote only</em> condition in which they were shown examples of firm
deficiencies; an <em>anecdote + statistics</em> condition in which they were shown the
same as in the anecdote condition, but also the number of deficiencies and
clients (but they were not explicitly provided the proportions); a <em>statistics
only</em> condition in which the proportions and clients without deficiencies are
made explicit; an <em>anecdote + enhanced statistics</em> condition that added the
anecdotes to the statistics only condition; and an <em>anecdote + enhanced
statistics – judgment orientation</em> condition, which emphasised the importance of
proportions and keeping absolute numbers in their relevant context.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> found equivalent proportions of participants choosing the firm
favoured by the statistical data by those viewing just the anecdotal information
and both the anecdotal information and the statistics. Further, participants
chose the statistically favoured firm less when seeing both types of information
than when seeing just statistics even when the underlying proportions were made
explicit (anecdote + enhanced statistics condition). This provided evidence of
anecdotal bias, as participants seemed to ignore the contradictory statistical
data. Further, having found no difference between the anecdote + statistics
condition and the anecdote only condition implies that the anecdotal bias effect
is “complete,” because it shows that the statistics displayed played no role in
influencing choice. A “partial” effect would have been if the anecdote +
statistics condition had been chosen more than the anecdote only condition. This
would mean that statistics still played some role in influencing choice.
Highlighting relevant statistical features and providing some explanation of
statistical inference reduced this anecdotal bias.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> conducted a similar study to <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, but with a capital
budgeting task. Participants had to choose between purchasing three
production-line machines for a mid-sized company that prints circuit boards. The
statistical data was constructed such that Machine A was better than Machine B,
which was better than Machine C. Participants were either given just this
information, or were also provided with an anecdote. This anecdote was in the
form of an email correspondence from a colleague from another company that
recommended against Machine A (the best option). As in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>,
participants were assigned to <em>anecdote + statistics</em> and <em>statistics only</em>
conditions. As well as these, in the <em>judgment orientation I &amp; II</em> conditions,
participants were told to “think like a scientist” and either received a short
or long explanation of what this means (essentially explaining the importance of
statistical inference). <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> found that including a contradictory
anecdote alongside the statistics (the anecdote + statistics condition) reduced
the proportion of choosing Machine A. This indicated evidence for anecdotal
bias. The addition of instructions that emphasise scientific thinking further
reduced this bias.</p>

<p>The extent of one’s reliance on an anecdote should arguably be moderated by its
similarity to the target problem. Previous work has discussed the importance of
weighting previous cases by their similarity to the present situation
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gilboa1995" role="doc-biblioref">Gilboa &amp; Schmeidler, 1995</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo et al., 2012</a>)</span>. For instance, on the one hand, an individual’s
decision of whether to take a certain medical treatment should be informed more
by a large-scale aggregated study showing 99% efficacy than by a story of
someone getting sick as a side-effect of the treatment that they read on social
media. On the other hand, the individual might have reason to be concerned if
the person who got sick was the individual’s identical twin. The inference that
the individual may therefore also need to be cautious about the treatment arises
from a specific causal model based on the two cases’ shared genetics.</p>
<p>There have been mixed results regarding the effect of similarity of anecdote on
the extent of anecdotal bias. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-hoeken2009" role="doc-biblioref">Hoeken &amp; Hustinx</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-hoeken2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>Study 3)</span> found evidence for an effect
of similarity on anecdotal bias with laypeople for a variety of claims. As well
as manipulating whether participants received a claim supported by an anecdote
or statistical evidence, they manipulated whether the anecdotal evidence was
similar or dissimilar to the claim that it was supporting. They found that
similar anecdotes were more persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-hoeken2001" role="doc-biblioref">Hoeken</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-hoeken2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>
did not find evidence for an effect of similarity about a local government
proposal with a student sample. Similarly, <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-hornikx2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hornikx</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-hornikx2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> considered the effect of
similarity on anecdote bias in local government policy decision-making. The
researchers did not find an effect of similarity, or an effect of anecdotes.
However, they measured persuasiveness and perhaps requiring to make more
concrete decisions will be a better test for a more real-life scenario.</p>
<p>Apart from the need to clarify the effect of similarity on the anecdotal bias
effect, it is important to clarify how such an effect might work. Research on
analogical reasoning has made the distinction between simple surface similarity
and deeper relational similarity <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gentner1983" role="doc-biblioref">Gentner, 1983</a>)</span>. As mentioned above, one’s use
of an anecdote should be moderated by the extent to which it is associated by an
underlying casual mechanism or mere surface similarity. Imagine a manager of a
multi-divisional company that is deciding how to allocate capital between an oil
well project and a technology project. Would hearing of a recent failed oil well
project at a different company influence the manager’s allocation decision? If
so, would it influence the decision because of the fact that the anecdote and
one of the target projects are from the same industry (surface similarity)? Or
would the manager look to the underlying reason of why the anecdote failed and
first identify if this mechanism is relevant to the target oil project? The
experiments in this chapter investigate whether the anecdotal bias effect is due
to causal inductive reasoning or merely the association between the valence of
the anecdote and surface similarity with the target.</p>

<p><a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes-1">Experiment 1</a> investigated whether anecdotal bias in a resource

</h2>
<p>In Experiment 1 I investigated the effects of similarity and anecdotal bias on
resource allocation. I asked participants to allocate a hypothetical budget
between two business projects. I also presented participants with a case study
that was either similar or dissimilar to the target project (but still from the
same industry). Further, participants were allocated to the same conditions as
in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, except that of the two judgement orientation conditions, I
only used the <em>judgment orientation II</em> condition. Further, I included an
anecdote only condition. For the conditions with statistical evidence,
participants also saw aggregated information about the success of similar
projects in the form of Net Present Value (NPV) and a reliability measure. As in
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, one project (Project A) was clearly better than the other
(Project B) when considering the statistical data, but the anecdotal evidence
suggested the opposite.</p>
<p>Previous research found that in resource allocation scenarios, people are more
persuaded by negative anecdotes than by positive statistical data
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg, 2018</a>)</span>. While other work has shown that similar anecdotes are more
persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-hoeken2009" role="doc-biblioref">Hoeken &amp; Hustinx, 2009</a>; Study 3)</span>, it is unclear how
similarity changes the anecdotal bias effect. As such, my main question is
whether anecdotal bias will be greater when the anecdote is similar, compared to
when it is dissimilar. Evidence of anecdotal bias is given when a statistics
only condition is different to an anecdote + statistics condition. Therefore, I
tested the following hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.1  (Anecdotal bias is moderated by the similarity of negative anecdotes)  </strong></span>The target project is supported by the statistics, but is inconsistent with the
anecdotes, thus: Allocations to the target project will be higher when only the
statistics are presented and when the statistics are accompanied by a low
similarity anecdote, in comparison to when the statistics are accompanied by a
high similarity anecdote. In addition, allocations are predicted to not be
affected by the low similarity anecdote at all. That is, the statistics only
condition should not differ from the low similarity anecdote + statistics
condition.
</div>
<p>I predicted that that the anecdotal bias effect will be complete, as in
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, such that the participants presented with the high similarity
anecdote along with the statistics will not use any statistical information.
Testing the high similarity condition will allow for an equivalent test to
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Therefore, I tested the following hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.2  (Effect of statistics for negative anecdotes)  </strong></span>Participants will allocate resources equivalently to the target project when in
the high similarity anecdote + statistics condition and when in the high
similarity anecdote only condition without enhancing the statisics explanation.
</div>
<p>Participants with additional information explaining the importance of
“scientific thinking” and statistical data may be less affected by anecdotes, as
in the <em>judgment orientation II</em> condition in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, here called “the
enhanced statistics condition.” Here, I test whether this effect protecting
against anecdotal bias would replicate in a resource allocation scenario.
Therefore, I tested the following hypothesis:</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 6.3  (Effect of enhanced statistics for negative anecdotes)  </strong></span>Participants will allocate more resources to the target project when in the high

<p>Two hundred and eighty-seven (199 female) people were recruited from a Psychology undergraduate sample at The University of Sydney. Participants were compensated with course credit. The average age was 20.79 (<em>SD</em> = 4.93, <em>min</em> = 16, <em>max</em> = 58). Participants reported an average of 1.66 (<em>SD</em> = 3.61, <em>min</em> = 0, <em>max</em> = 32) years of work in a business setting, and an average of 0.8 (<em>SD</em> = 1.57, <em>min</em> = 0, <em>max</em> = 12) years of business education. The mean completion time was 22.11 (<em>SD</em> = 96.95, <em>min</em> = 1.67, <em>max</em> = 1,101.48) minutes. Table <a href="anecdotes.html#tab:condition-allocation-anecdotes-1">6.1</a>

that these values were sourced from a study with a large sample. Those in the

budget between two target projects that come from different businesses within a
company. Participants were presented with information about each business’ name,
location, integration (vertical or horizontal), and organisational structure
(centralised or decentralised). See

investment. Participants in the anecdote only condition saw just this
information (see

<p>Participants that were presented with an anecdote (those in either the anecdote
only, anecdote + statistics , or anecdote + enhanced statistics conditions) saw
a description of a business project and an accompanying “analysis.”
Figures <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:anecdote-similarity-high-materials-anecdotes-1">6.3</a>
and <a href="anecdotes.html#fig:anecdote-similarity-low-materials-anecdotes-1">6.4</a> show the anecdote
display for those in the high and low similarity conditions, respectively. The
project description had a similar layout to the target projects. That is, it
contained information about the business name, location, integration, and
organisational structure of the business, and detailed predicted features of the
project. Underneath this description was a paragraph of text that participants
were told was an analysis of why the project failed. Therefore, this text
references each of the features in the description in order to justify the
project failing.</p>
<p>Those in the high similarity condition saw a description of a project from a
business with the same type of investment. All categorical attributes were
identical to the relevant target project (Project A), and the numerical
attributes were all made to be lower than those in Project A. In the analysis,
the numerical attributes were explained to have failed because they were not as
high as certain cut-offs. Critically, these cut-offs were made to all be higher
than the relevant values in Project A. This was done to make sure that the
numerical attributes in the anecdote seem more relevant to those in Project A.
For instance, for Project A, oil extraction was 2200L an hour, for the anecdote
it was 2000L an hour, and the cutoff was 3000L an hour. As such, a failure of
the anecdote because of an insufficient oil extraction rated will seem more
relevant since they both share the state of being lower than the cut-off in the
analysis. Note, however, that there was uncertainty about the generalisability
of these cut-off values because the participants did not receive a explicit
indication about whether these values were meant to generalise to other cases.</p>

<p>A two-way ANOVA was conducted to investigate the interaction of similarity (low
and high) and anecdote conditions (anecdote only, statistics + anecdote,
excluding anecdote + enhanced statistics). This allowed me to identify the role
of statistics. The interaction between anecdote condition and similarity,
excluding the enhanced condition was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(M = -13.71\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-26.39,~-1.03]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(240) = -2.13\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .034\)</span>. Specifically, the
difference between allocations when only seeing an anecdote and seeing the
anecdote + statistics was greater when the anecdote was similar,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -21.56\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-32.30,~-10.83]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(240) = -4.74\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>; compared to when it
was dissimilar, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -7.85\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-18.59,~2.88]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(240) = -1.73\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .198\)</span>.
Therefore, I found evidence of “partial” anecdotal bias in the high similarity
condition, since the anecdote + statistics condition was lower than the
statistics only condition, but higher than the anecdote only condition.</p>

allocations and the follow-up relevance ratings. As seen in

the specific relevance ratings interact with similarity condition,

that specific relevance ratings are related to allocations, but only in the high
similarity condition. Further, there were no significant associations with the
general relevance ratings. This suggests that people are reasoning about the
connection between the anecdote and target, as opposed to simply reacting to the
failed project and associating that with the project industry.</p>

<p>I found support for Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1">6.1</a>, as
participants allocated less resources when seeing both the anecdote and
statistics, than when just seeing statistics, in the high similarity condition,
but not in the low similarity condition. This shows that while anecdotal bias
exists when the anecdote is similar, participants are not influenced when the
causal mechanisms do not match. Contrary to
Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1">6.2</a>, I found that while participants
were influenced by the anecdote, they still made some use of the statistics.
This is different from <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, who found no difference between an
anecdote only and a anecdote + statistics condition, indicating a “complete”
effect of anecdotal bias. Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1">6.3</a>
was also not supported, as the added enhanced statistical language used to
encourage participants to use the statistical information did not contribute to
reducing participants’ reliance on anecdotes.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 was limited because it only considered an anecdote with a
<em>negative</em> valence. That is, the case study was of a project that failed.
However, in real life these case studies are often ones with <em>positive</em> valence.
That is, a story of a successful company. In fact, it may be the case that in
business, the anecdotes that are used are more likely to be positive, because of
survivorship bias. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> found an anecdotal bias effect in negative
anecdotes, but not in positive anecdotes. This may be because the work was done
in medical decision-making and in this domain, a loss of health may be felt
stronger than an equivalent gain of health. Therefore, in Experiment 2 I added a
condition with a positive anecdote, in order to investigate whether anecdote
valence will impact the anecdotal bias effect.</p>
<p>Further, it was unclear if the effects found in Experiment 1 were related to
participants’ perceptions of the type of sampling used in selecting the
anecdotes. The instructions in Experiment 1 do not explain how the anecdote that
is displayed to participants was chosen. Intentional or random sampling has been
shown to affect people’s decision-making <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-hayes2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hayes et al., 2019</a>)</span>. In the case of the
current experiments, the sampling assumption changes the extent to which it is
rational to use the anecdote or not. It may be considered rational to choose the
anecdote over the aggregated data if 1. the anecdote was not sampled randomly
from the pool of anecdotes, and 2. the anecdote is more similar to the target
project than any of the other anecdotes in the pool in relevant ways. That is,
if the anecdote was chosen because of its high relevance to the target project,
it would be irrational to ignore it. In Experiment 1 it was unclear whether
participants might have held these beliefs. In order to control for these
assumptions, in Experiment 2 I added text to the instructions that clarified
that the anecdote 1. was sampled randomly from the pool of anecdotes, and 2. is
not significantly more similar to the target project than any of the other
anecdotes in the pool.</p>

</div>

<div id="anecdotes-2" class="section level2" number="6.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Experiment 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#anecdotes-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes-1">Experiment 1</a> replicated the anecdotal bias effect. That is,
people use an anecdote more when presented with conflicting statistics than when
anecdote alone and less than when statistics alone. However, anecdote similarity
moderated this effect, such that anecdotal bias is stronger when the anecdote is
similar to the current task, than when it is dissimilar. Experiment 1 only used
a negative anecdote because previous research found anecdotal bias for negative,
but not for positive anecdotes <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al., 2019</a>)</span>. However, <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>
considered medical decision-making, so this effect of anecdote valence may be
different in a business scenario. When considering medicine, it is likely that
negative anecdotes are more salient than positive ones. Positive health can
generally simply mean a lack of change of one’s current state, whereas a
negative health outcome almost necessarily involves a change for the worse.
Further, Experiment 1 did not clarify certain assumptions about the way the
displayed anecdote was sampled from the pool of anecdotes.</p>
<p>Therefore, in Experiment 2 I added a within-subjects anecdote valence
manipulation and manipulated anecdote similarity within-subjects, in order to
increase the experiment’s power. Further, I removed the anecdote + enhanced
statistics manipulation as Experiment 1 did not find evidence for its efficacy.
All participants saw the statistics only condition, as it did not contain an
anecdote, and therefore did not need to be manipulated between-subjects. Each
participant therefore saw five displays, with one statistics only condition, and
four displays for either the anecdote only condition, or the anecdote +
statistics condition. These four anecdote displays consisted of the similarity
(low and high) <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> valence (negative and positive) conditions.</p>
<p>I expected to replicate the effects of Experiment 1, as well as seeing the
reverse effect in the positive valence condition. Also, I expected that
statistics will have an effect similar to Experiment 1, contrary to
Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1">6.2</a>. Therefore, as well as again
testing Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1">6.1</a>, I tested the
following hypotheses (see Appendix <a href="anecdotes-appendix.html#anecdotes-2-appendix">C.2</a> for a plot of a
simulation of all hypothesised effects):</p>

The mean completion time was 15.01 (<em>SD</em> = 8.73, <em>min</em> = 2.57, <em>max</em> = 58.71) minutes. Table <a href="anecdotes.html#tab:condition-allocation-anecdotes-2">6.2</a>
shows the between-subjects condition allocation. Similarity and valence were
manipulated within-subjects. Therefore, each participant was in one of two
between-subjects anecdote conditions, and saw five displays (statistics only,
and one for each similarity/valence combination).

<p>To investigate whether anecdotal bias was moderated by similarity, I compared
allocations between the anecdote + statistics high and low similarity conditions and the

However, the difference between responses to the statistics-only projects and

This provides evidence for the moderation of anecdotal bias by similarity for
negative anecdotes.</p>
<p>In the positive valence condition, allocations were higher in the statistics-only
condition than in the anecdote + statistics low similarity condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -31.73\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-41.86,~-21.60]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(141) = -6.19\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.

<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 14.10\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([3.97,~24.23]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(141) = 2.75\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .007\)</span>.

<p>As in Experiment 1, I investigated the extent to which the statistical
information influenced participants’ allocations. When in the negative valence
condition, participants allocated more to the high similarity anecdote +
statistics project than those in the high similarity anecdote-only condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -12.67\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-23.53,~-1.81]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(336.36) = -2.29\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .022\)</span>.

<p>I found support for Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1">6.1</a> and
Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-2">6.5</a>, as participants showed a

Hypothesis <a href="anecdotes.html#hyp:statistics-positive-anecdotes-2">6.7</a>, I found that participants
seemed to incorporate the statistical information into their judgements, in both
negative and positive anecdotes.</p>
<p>Experiment 2 therefore found that, unlike in the medical domain, the effect of
anecdotes in financial decision-making does not seem to depend on anecdote
valence. Further, as in Experiment 1, and unlike <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, the anecdotal
bias effect does not seem to be complete, with statistics still playing some
role in participants’ decisions despite the effect of the anecdote.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> General discussion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#general-discussion-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Most of the hypotheses were supported. I found that people’s decisions are
influenced by anecdotes even when aggregated data is available in a
resource-allocation context. I also made three novel findings: 1. I found that
the anecdotal bias effect is only seen when participants consider the anecdote
as sufficiently relevant to the target at hand, 2. participants still seem to
integrate statistics in their decisions, and 3. these effects are seen in both
negative and positive anecdotes.</p>
<p>The first novel finding from these experiments was that participants appeared to
moderate their use of anecdotal evidence. Specifically, when the anecdote
appeared to be causally relevant, participants used it in their decisions.
However, when it appeared irrelevant, participants relied on statistics almost
entirely. The findings in the high similarity condition are largely congruent
with findings from other work investigating anecdotal bias in business
decision-making. As in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, I found that people
allocate less resources to a project that is successful according to statistical
evidence, but is displayed alongside a contradictory similar anecdote, than to a
project with just the statistics.</p>
<p>It seems that participants made the distinction between the low and high
similarity conditions based on underlying structure of the anecdote. The low
similarity condition always consisted of the same project type, for each domain,
as in the high similarity condition. For instance, in one variation, both the
high and low similarity anecdotes were of oil well projects. This means that
participants were sensitive to the specific information presented to them in the
anecdote description and “analysis,” and did not simply use the project type for
their inferences. Further, participants’ answers to the follow up questions
indicated that, while they considered that the anecdote was relevant in when
considering the target project, they did not consider it as relevant to other
such projects. In other words, participants did not appear to carelessly use
anecdotal evidence in their decisions, but instead appeared to carefully
consider the anecdote based on its particular causal structure.</p>
<p>The second novel finding from these experiments was that participants that saw
both statistics and anecdotal evidence did not completely disregard the
statistical measures. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> found a “complete” effect of anecdotal bias,
because in their study, these two conditions were equivalent. This meant that
the statistics they provided had a negligible effect on participants’ decisions.
These experiments, on the other hand, showed a “partial” anecdotal bias effect,
with allocations being different between when participants saw only an anecdote
and when they also saw the statistics. It seems as if participants integrated
the anecdote with the statistical information. As mentioned above, this suggests
that people’s evaluation of evidence might be more sensitive than previously
thought.</p>
<p>This discrepancy might be a result of the sampled population. Since <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">Freling et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>
found a stronger effect of anecdote when decisions were more personally
relevant, the manager sample in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> may have simply been more
personally invested in the task than the laypeople in the experiments in this
chapter. Similarly, <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-yang2015" role="doc-biblioref">Yang et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-yang2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> found that anxiety increases anecdotal bias in
risky choice. It might also be due to the anecdote + statistics condition not
being equivalent between <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and the present work. Specifically, the
statistics shown in the anecdote + statistics condition in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> were
not the same ones that were shown in the same study’s statistics only condition,
unlike in both the present experiments and <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Wainberg</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-wainberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Instead, it was the
anecdote + enhanced statistics condition that contained the same statistics as
in the statistics only condition. This suggests that people integrate statistics
when they are sufficiently clear and no further interpretation is required.</p>
<p>The third novel finding from these experiments was that anecdotal bias was seen
in both negative and positive anecdotes. Most studies in the literature
considered anecdotes that involve an example with negative consequences (a
<em>negative</em> anecdote). For instance, a medication that leads to an adverse
reaction in a patient. However, there is not much work in the literature that
involves an anecdote with positive consequences (a <em>positive</em> anecdote).
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> found an asymmetry in the effect of the anecdote, such that the
effect was stronger when a person in a description did not get better after a
medication (negative), compared to when they did get better (positive). In the
present experiments I found a more symmetrical effect, such that both the
effects of the moderated anecdotal bias and the influence of statistics were
found in both valence conditions. The difference between this and the finding
from <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> might be due to the domain of the task in that people are
more focused on negative outcomes in the medical domain.</p>

<p>The current work adds to the current understanding of the way people use
different forms of evidence in their decision-making. Previous work mostly
investigated the relative influence of statistics and anecdotes by comparing
anecdote and statistics conditions. The current work shows that comparing a
joint anecdote + statistics condition to both an anecdote only and statistics
only condition allows for a more specific representation of participants’
anecdotal bias. The influence of anecdote can be seen in the comparison between
statistics only and the anecdote + statistics condition, but the effect of
statistics can be seen in the comparison between the combined condition and the
anecdote only condition. These two effects allow to determine the independent
influence of anecdote and statistics, respectively. Further use of such a design
in future research might help to further understand the conditions under which
these types of evidence are used.</p>
<p>It seems that in some of the anecdotal bias literature there is an assumption
that using anecdotal evidence over statistical evidence is necessarily
irrational. This likely arises from examples from the medical domain in which
such decisions are indeed irrational (e.g., believing that vaccines cause
certain disorders despite the available evidence). In such cases, people
over-rely on anecdotes and should be relying more on aggregated data. However, a
case could be made for a rational use of anecdote based on the similarity of the
anecdote to the target. For instance, there are times in which an anecdote is so
similar to the target situation (e.g., the identical twin example in the
<a href="#effect-of-similarity-anecdotes">Introduction</a>) that it would be unwise not to
consider the anecdote. That is, the use of anecdote should depend on both 1. the
strength of the underlying causal structure between it and the target problem,
and 2. the distribution of similarity across cases in the sample on which the
statistics are based. People should use an anecdote when casual structure is
significantly more relevant than other cases in available data. It is also
important to note that there could also be misleading similarity. For instance,
if someone is highly similar, but not along some key hidden dimension that is
the real causal thing to care about, then using the anecdote may be the wrong
thing to do. What seems to be important is a sensitivity to relational, rather
than surface level similarity. Future research should further investigate how
varying the assumptions that people have about sampling from a data set of
anecdotes influences their anecdotal bias. Such assumptions can include the size
of the sample and the shape of the distribution.</p>

<p>The current work can contribute to managerial decision making by suggesting
insights into how managers make decisions about business case studies and
statistical information about certain industries. Managers of large companies
are often in a difficult position; they have incomplete information and an
uncertain environment. Despite this, different biases and responses to those
biases can be anticipated for different levels of uncertainty. For instance, a
manager may be in a position in which they are presented with both a convincing
case study that suggests a certain course of action, and also be in the
possession of aggregated data. The manager needs to be able to weigh the
evidence accordingly. The work in this chapter suggests that there are three
elements to consider: 1. the quality of the aggregated data (determined by
factors such as the sample size), 2. the relative similarity of the cases in the
data pool to the situation at hand, and 3. the similarity of the anecdote to the
situation at hand. For instance, if the anecdote is uniquely similar to the
target situation, and it is significantly more similar than the rest of the
cases in the data set, then it should have more weight than an anecdote that
comes from a pool of cases that are all just as similar to the target.</p>
<p>In a situation in which aggregated data is not available, however, managers
should rely more on anecdotes that are more similar in causal structure. That
is, they should be wary of merely using the surface similarity to make
inferences, and instead consider the underlying relational structures. The
present data suggest that laypeople can do this to an extent, with participants
not being completely swayed by the mere similarity of the type of business
project. However, future research should investigate this further to better
understand the boundaries of people’s analogical reasoning in such situations.</p>
