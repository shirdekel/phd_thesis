<p>This appendix contains supplementary materials and analyses for the three
experiments reported in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>. In addition, I report five
related experiments. Experiment 4 was identical to Experiment 1, except that
alignment was manipulated within-subjects, it did not include a no NPV
condition, and there was no forecasting measure. Experiment 5 replicated
Experiment 1, but only tested the forecasting effect and did so with a sample
with investing experience. Experiment 6 replicated Experiment 5 but with a
larger sample size and a lay sample. Experiment 7 attempted to facilitate a use
of numerical reliability through explicit hints. Experiment 8 tested both verbal
and numerical reliability effects in an all within-subjects design. However,
unlike Experiment 3, the design of Experiment 8 did not allow for a direct
comparison of alignment conditions.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">B.1</span> Experiment 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alignment-2-appendix"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In addition to the allocation measure, I also asked participants to rank the
projects and forecast their future returns. I included the ranking task before
the allocation task in order to encourage alignment and to have another measure
of participants’ decision-making. I added the forecasting task (described
further <a href="alignment-appendix.html#forecasting-materials-alignment-2">below</a>) in order to test whether
the variance in people’s forecasts is affected by alignment and NPV reliability.</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:ranking-all-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis B.1  </strong></span>All allocation effects will replicate in the ranking measure.

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:forecasting-mean-all-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis B.2  </strong></span>All allocation effects will replicate in the forecasting mean measure.
</div>
<p>In the forecasting measures, I expect that more alignable differences therefore
bring about more certainty about forecasting decisions, since participants will
have more easily comparable information. As such, people’s forecasting should be
less variable when comparing projects with alignable differences, than when
comparing projects with non-alignable differences.</p>

<div class="hypothesis">
<span id="hyp:forecasting-sd-alignment-alignment-2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis B.3  </strong></span>The standard deviation of participants’ forecasts will be higher, on average,
in the low alignment condition than in the high alignment condition.

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and verbally-instructed NPV reliability on participants’ rankings of the
target project. As seen in Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-alignment-2-ranking">B.8</a>, the
alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV amount interaction was

<span class="math inline">\(F(6.62, 370.54) = 2.70\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .011\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .046\)</span>. This
effect seems to be driven by the differences between the no NPV condition and
the conditions with NPV across the two alignment conditions. Specifically, in
the low alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was significantly lower in the
no NPV condition than both the low reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = -6.56\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-10.26,~-2.85]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = -3.50\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>, and the high

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and verbally-instructed NPV reliability on participants’ confidence rating of
their decisions. As seen in Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-alignment-2-confidence">B.9</a>, the
alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV amount interaction was not

Contrary to the allocation and ranking data, in
the low alignment condition, there were no significant differences in the linear
NPV trend between the no NPV condition and low reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 10.73\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-30.15,~51.61]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 0.52\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .604\)</span>, nor the high

However, as above, in the high alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was
significantly lower in the no NPV condition than the high reliability condition,

<p>Hypothesis <a href="alignment-appendix.html#hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1">B.4</a> was not supported, as I
did not find evidence of a main effect of alignment on participants’ confidence
in their allocation decisions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the
difference in confidence between reliability conditions is greater in the low
alignment condition. This may reflect participants’ difficulty in making sense
of their choices when alignment was low, given more confidence when assured of
the reliability of NPV. In the high alignment condition, on the other hand,
regardless of reliability condition, they had a way of using the reliability
information. Further, confidence also seemed to increase more with NPV, on
average, more when projects were dissimilar, which provides evidence for their
reliance on NPV in this situation. There was limited evidence for the effect of
alignment on forecast variability. As such, a future experiment will attempt to
replicate this result with more participants.</p>

<p>I conducted a power analysis through simulation of the effects hypothesised in
Experiment 3 (and the simple effects implied by them). I simulated
data with the same regression coefficients as Experiment 2 for the explicit
condition, no effects for the implicit condition (as shown in
Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-simulation-alignment-8">B.19</a>), and the intercept and residual
variance of Experiment 2. I analysed the null effects using the two one-sided
tests (TOST) procedure, or <em>equivalence</em> testing <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lakens2018" role="doc-biblioref">Lakens et al., 2018</a>)</span>, and setting the
smallest effect size of interest to the smallest difference that leads to a
significant equivalence between low and high implicit reliability for low
alignment in Experiment 3. Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:power-curve-alignment-8">B.20</a> shows the
resulting power curve. The analysis suggests a total sample size of
448 (112 <span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> 4).</p>

<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability type (averaging over reliability amount) in the low

between allocation and NPV amount for those in the explicit low reliability
condition was significantly stronger for those in the low alignment condition,
than for those in the high alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 35.68\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([22.27,~49.09]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 5.23\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.
The linear NPV amount trend for those in the low alignment condition was
significantly stronger for those in the explicit reliability condition, than for
those in the implicit reliability condition (averaging over reliability amount),
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 11.48\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.19,~22.77]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.00\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .046\)</span>. The linear
NPV amount trend for those in the implicit reliability condition was not
significantly “equivalent” between those in the low and high reliability
conditions for both those in the low alignment
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 1.64\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-8.74,~12.03]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 0.31\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .620\)</span>

However, this is likely to be because I used a “lowest effect size of interest”
that originated from an analysis used before data collection that was different
to the one that one used after data collection. Specifically, a univariate
linear model was originally used (treating NPV amount as a continuous
predictor), whereas the data was ultimately analysed using a multivariate linear
model (treating NPV amount as a repeated measures factor).</p>

</h2>
<p>Experiment 4 further investigated the effects of alignment and verbal NPV
reliability information on financial resource allocation decisions. I replicated
the same methodology as in <a href="#method-alignment-2">Experiment 1</a>, except for two
main changes. First, I manipulated the alignment conditions within subjects.
Second, I removed the no NPV condition to the NPV reliability variable.</p>
<p>I expected to replicate the results of <a href="#results-alignment-2">Experiment 1</a>.
Specifically, I expect that in the high alignment condition, participants will
be able to respond to each reliability condition, whereas, in the low alignment
condition, they will rely more on NPV regardless of reliability condition.</p>
<p>In addition to the all-project allocation data analysed above, here I report
analyses for the just for the “target project.” This is allocation of resources
to the project that had the highest NPV, but the lowest value on concrete
measures intrinsic to the actual product, e.g., the capacity of a laptop in
gigabytes. Therefore, a higher allocation value indicated a higher reliance on
NPV. Further, I report the method and analyses for the confidence measure.</p>

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment,
verbal NPV reliability, and NPV amount on participants’ confidence in their
allocations. As seen in Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-alignment-1-confidence">B.27</a>, the
difference between alignment conditions was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(1, 69) = 2.76\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .101\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .038\)</span>. However, the reliability <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>
alignment interaction was significant, as well as the NPV amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>
alignment interaction. I conducted an exploratory analysis of the relevant
simple effects for each interaction, applying a Šidák correction to the p values
for each effect. None of the simple effects were significant after the
correction.</p>
<p>The raw mean differences indicated that there was a greater difference between
reliability conditions in the low alignment condition,

a stronger linear trend of NPV amount in the low alignment condition,

<p>Experiment 4 found evidence for most of the hypotheses. As per
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2">4.4</a>, laypeople responded
to verbal reliability instructions in the high alignment condition. Contrary to
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2">4.5</a>, however, I found that
participants also did this in the low reliability condition. That is, regardless
of the type of project display, participants tended to use NPV more when they
were told that it was reliable and tended to use it less when they were told
that it was unreliable. Further, I did not find evidence that this effect is
moderated by alignment condition, contrary to
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2">4.3</a>. However,
I did find that the linear NPV amount trend was higher in the high than low
alignment condition, when averaging over reliability amount, as predicted in
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>. This suggests that
overall participants still make more use of NPV information when it is hard to
compare between projects.</p>
<p>Despite these results, it is unclear to what extent the within-subjects design
influenced participants’ allocations, as they saw both high and low alignment
conditions. Further, it is unclear how participants would have responded to the
projects without NPV. As such, in Experiment 2 I used a between-subject design
for all factors and added a no NPV condition.</p>
<p>Hypothesis <a href="alignment-appendix.html#hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1">B.4</a> was not supported, as I
did not find evidence of a main effect of alignment on participants’ confidence
in their allocation decisions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the
difference in confidence between reliability conditions is greater in the low
alignment condition. This may reflect participants’ difficulty in making sense
of their choices when alignment was low, given more confidence when assured of
the reliability of NPV. In the high alignment condition, on the other hand,
regardless of reliability condition, they had a way of using the reliability
information. Further, confidence also seemed to increase more with NPV, on
average, more when projects were dissimilar, which provides evidence for their
reliance on NPV in this situation.</p>

<p>Experiment 7 investigated potential ways to facilitate people’s use of variance
in resource allocation. Arguably, people’s decisions should be moderated by
variance, especially with a small set of projects. That is, when considering
between two potential measures to use for resource allocation, underlying
variance should serve as a moderator for decision making, with measures with
narrow ranges being relied upon more than those with wider ranges. As such, in
this experiment I presented participants with the same resource allocation
scenario as in Experiment 1, but only in low numerical reliability displays. I
varied both the variance associated with NPV, and the extent to which I
explicitly hinted to them to use the variance information. I predicted that
participants would be more likely to moderate their allocations through variance
when told explicitly to do so with increased salience for variance, than when
only salience is increase, or when no hint is given.</p>

<p>The materials were similar to Experiment 1, as the same laptop displays were
used, but I added the <em>Cash inflow range</em> row to the table (see
Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:projects-alignment-6">B.33</a>). Further, participants in the No Hint
condition saw the same instructions as in Experiment 1, those in the Salience
Only condition saw the instructions along with a sentence that draws attention
to the <em>Cash inflow range</em> row, and those in the Salience + Hint condition saw
the instructions along with a specific description of how to use the variance
information in their allocation decisions.</p>

<p>Experiment 7 found that explicitly telling participants how to use variance
information to moderate their allocations did not help them do so. However,
there was an increased reliance on NPV with more hints in the ranking data. This
suggests that the hint manipulations potentially simply increase participants’
attention to NPV.</p>

</h2>
<p>Experiment 8 tested the alignment and reliability effects found in the previous
experiments addressing the limitations of the previous experiments. In
Experiments 1 and 4 I found an verbal reliability effect, in which laypeople
allocated more resources to a high NPV project, depending on how reliable they
were told NPV was as a measure. In Experiment 2 I found a lack of an numerical
reliability effect, in which business students allocated an equivalent amount of
resources to projects associated with a high variance NPV, as projects with a
low NPV. Testing these two effects in two different populations did not account
for potential expertise effects. As such, in Experiment 8 I tested both effects
with a naive sample. Further, I used projects whose features more clearly
indicate their profitability, and included more project domains.</p>

<p>Fifty-two people (33 female) were recruited from both the online recruitment platform Prolific and a Psychology undergraduate sample at The University of Sydney. Participants from Prolific were compensated at a rate of £5 an hour, and participants from the undergraduate sample were compensated with course credit. The average age was 24.46 (<em>SD</em> = 7.77, <em>min</em> = 18, <em>max</em> = 68). Participants reported an average of 2.63 (<em>SD</em> = 4.16, <em>min</em> = 0, <em>max</em> = 25) years of work in a business setting, and an average of 0.81 (<em>SD</em> = 1.39, <em>min</em> = 0, <em>max</em> = 5) years of business education. The mean completion time was 35.57 (<em>SD</em> = 71.96, <em>min</em> = 7.36, <em>max</em> = 511.74) minutes.. All conditions were presented within-subjects:
alignment (low and high), NPV reliability type (numerical and verbal), NPV
amount (low and high), and NPV reliability amount (low and high).</p>

<p>Participants saw and responded to four webpage displays. At the top of each
display was a text preamble, and underneath this a table that contained project
descriptions. The two columns to the right of each description contained text
boxes for participants to enter a value for the project ranking and budget
allocation. Alignment was manipulated by asking participants to either compare
between each of the project pairs (high alignment), or across all eight projects
in the display (low alignment). For instance, in the high alignment display,
participants had to compare between two railway projects, and then separately
between two logistics projects, etc. However, in the low alignment display,
participants had to compare railway projects to logistics projects directly.
This was manipulated within-subjects, such that project descriptions were
identical across alignment conditions and only the the type of comparison (and
the associated preamble text).</p>

reliability (either numerical through ranges or verbal through explicit labels).</p>

<p>The value of each type of reliability was also manipulated. Explicit reliability
was manipulated by varying whether participants were told that a project pair is
in an industry in which NPV is considered a reliable or unreliable measure.
Implicit reliability was manipulated by presenting NPVs alongside numerical
ranges instead of verbal reliability information about them, and varying
whether the range is high or low. Both of these were manipulated within-display,
such that for four projects in each display NPV is reliable, and for four it is
unreliable.</p>
<p>Each project had an associated NPV, which was crossed with each project pair’s
intrinsic features. That is, each pair had one project with a high NPV and low
intrinsic feature values, and one project with a low NPV and high intrinsic
feature values. As such, we inferred a reliance on NPV if participants allocated
the high NPV project more resources, or a reliance on the intrinsic features if
participants allocated the low NPV project more resources.</p>

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and NPV reliability type on participants project allocations. I was unable to
conduct a direct comparison of the two alignment conditions due to the different
allocation input scales, so I compared the NPV reliability amount <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV
amount interaction separately in each alignment condition (see
Figures <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-alignment-7-allocation-alignment-low">B.40</a>
and <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-alignment-7-allocation-alignment-high">B.41</a>). This interaction was
significant for both the high alignment condition,
;
and the low alignment condition,
.
However, there was a significant effect of NPV in the low verbal reliability
condition in the high alignment condition,

<p>I found that in the verbal reliability condition, participants allocated
according to the reliability information, for both low and high alignment
conditions. In the numerical reliability condition, there were no differences in
allocations, for both low and high alignment conditions. Further, there was an
effect of NPV in low reliability for the high alignment condition, but not the
low alignment condition.</p>
<p>This experiment shows that similar to the previous experiments, when controlling
for presentation and domain, people still find it easier to allocate resources
based on explicit reliability information when projects are comparable. However,
due to the difference in scale across alignment conditions, a direct alignment
effect was more difficult to test than with the previous experiments. Further,
similar to Experiment 2, I showed that people without much business experience
also struggle to use range information in resource allocation to such an extreme
extent that they do not seem to be using any coherent allocation strategy.</p>
