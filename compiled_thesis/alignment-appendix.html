<p>This appendix contains supplementary materials and analyses for the three
experiments reported in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>. In addition, five related
experiments are reported. Experiment 4 was identical to Experiment 1, except
that alignment was manipulated within-subjects, it did not include a no NPV
condition, and there was no forecasting measure. Experiment 5 replicated
Experiment 1, but only tested the forecasting effect and did so with a sample
that had investing experience. Experiment 6 replicated Experiment 5 but with a
larger sample size and a lay sample. Experiment 7 attempted to facilitate a use
of numerical reliability through explicit hints. Experiment 8 tested both verbal
and numerical reliability effects in an all within-subjects design. However,
unlike Experiment 3, the design of Experiment 8 did not allow for a direct
comparison of alignment conditions.</p>

<p>In addition to the allocation measure, participants were also asked to rank the
projects and forecast their future returns. The ranking task was included before
the allocation task in order to encourage alignment and to have another measure
of participants’ decision-making. The forecasting task was added (described
further below in Section <a href="alignment-appendix.html#forecasting-materials-alignment-2">B.1.1.1.2</a>) in order to
test whether the variance in people’s forecasts is affected by alignment and NPV
reliability.</p>

<p>In the forecasting measures, more alignable differences were expected to bring
about more certainty about forecasting decisions, since participants will have
more easily comparable information. As such, people’s forecasting should be less
variable when comparing projects with alignable differences, than when comparing
projects with non-alignable differences.</p>

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and verbally-instructed NPV reliability on participants’ rankings of the
target project. As shown in Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-alignment-2-ranking">B.8</a>, the
alignment <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability level <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV interaction was

effect seems to be driven by the differences between the no NPV condition and
the conditions with NPV across the two alignment conditions. Specifically, in
the low alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was significantly lower in the
no NPV condition than both the low reliability condition,

Contrary to the allocation and ranking data, in
the low alignment condition, there were no significant differences in the linear
NPV trend between the no NPV condition and low reliability condition,
<span class="math inline">\(M = 10.73\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-30.15,~51.61]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(112) = 0.52\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .604\)</span>, nor the high

<p>Hypothesis <a href="alignment-appendix.html#hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1">B.4</a> was not supported, as
there was no evidence of a main effect of alignment on participants’ confidence
in their allocation decisions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the
difference in confidence between reliability conditions is greater in the low
alignment condition. This may reflect participants’ difficulty in making sense
of their choices when alignment was low, given more confidence when assured of
the reliability of NPV. In the high alignment condition, on the other hand,
regardless of reliability condition, they had a way of using the reliability
information. Further, confidence also seemed to increase more with NPV, on
average, more when projects were dissimilar, which provides evidence for their
reliance on NPV in this situation. There was limited evidence for the effect of
alignment on forecast variability. Experiments 5 and 6 attempted to replicate
this result with more participants.</p>

<p>The allocation and ranking data show that participants were affected by the
similarity of options, but were not affected by variance information. After the
main task of this experiment, participants were shown a short lecture about the
importance of variance information when making allocation decisions. They were
then presented with half of their previous allocations and gave them an
opportunity to amend their allocations. It was hypothesised that participants
will be more sensitive to variance after the educational intervention.</p>
<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of phase on
participants’ project allocations. As shown in
Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-alignment-3-variance-lecture">B.18</a>, the four-way interaction
was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(F(2.56, 133.09) = 1.74\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .169\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\eta}^2_p = .032\)</span>.
Further, the NPV <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> phase <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability level interactions were not
significant for either the low alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 4.43\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-23.71,~32.58]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(52) = 0.32\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .753\)</span>; or the

low alignment condition, the linear NPV trend (averaged over reliability level)
was significantly weaker after the lecture, compared with the linear NPV trend
before the lecture, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -12.85\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-24.08,~-1.62]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(52) = -2.30\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .026\)</span>.
However, this comparison was not significant in the high alignment condition,

suggest that participants did not become better informed by NPV numerical
reliability after the variance lecture. There was, however, some reduction in
reliance on NPV overall when projects were dissimilar.</p>

<p>A power analysis was conducted through simulation of the effects hypothesised in
Experiment 3 (and the simple effects implied by them). The simulated data used
the same regression coefficients as Experiment 2 for the explicit condition, no
effects for the implicit condition (as shown in
Figure <a href="alignment-appendix.html#fig:plot-simulation-alignment-8">B.20</a>), and the intercept and residual
variance of Experiment 2. The null effects were analysed using the two one-sided
tests (TOST) procedure, or <em>equivalence</em> testing <span class="citation">(Lakens et al., <a href="#ref-lakens2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, and setting the
smallest effect size of interest to the smallest difference that leads to a
significant equivalence between low and high implicit reliability for low
alignment in Experiment 8 (see Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-7">B.8</a>).

<p>The three-way interaction (reliability level <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> NPV <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> reliability
type) in the high alignment condition was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 35.43\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([20.74,~50.12]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 4.74\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>. The NPV <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>
reliability type (averaging over reliability level) in the low alignment
condition was significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 11.48\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.19,~22.77]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.00\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .046\)</span>. The association
between allocation and NPV for those in the explicit low reliability
condition was significantly stronger for those in the low alignment condition,
than for those in the high alignment condition,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 35.68\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([22.27,~49.09]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 5.23\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>.
The linear NPV trend for those in the low alignment condition was
significantly stronger for those in the explicit reliability condition, than for
those in the implicit reliability condition (averaging over reliability level),
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 11.48\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.19,~22.77]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.00\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .046\)</span>. The linear
NPV trend for those in the implicit reliability condition was not
significantly “equivalent” between those in the low and high reliability
conditions for both those in the low alignment
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 1.64\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-8.74,~12.03]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 0.31\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .620\)</span>
and high alignment conditions
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = -1.21\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-11.59,~9.18]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 0.22\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .589\)</span>.
However, this is likely to be because the “lowest effect size of interest”
estimate originated from an analysis used before data collection that was
different to the one that one used after data collection. Specifically, a
univariate linear model was originally used (treating NPV as a continuous
predictor), whereas the data were ultimately analysed using a multivariate
linear model (treating NPV as a repeated measures factor). In the numerical
reliability condition, a pilot experiment (see Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-7">B.8</a>)
suggested that the linear NPV trend would be equivalent between those in the low
and high alignment conditions, averaged over reliability level. However, the
test of equivalence was not significant,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta M = 15.19\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([3.90,~26.48]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(444) = 2.64\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .996\)</span>.</p>

<p>Experiment 4 further investigated the effects of alignment and verbal NPV
reliability information on capital allocation decisions. Experiment 4 used the
same methodology as in Experiment 1 (see Section <a href="alignment.html#method-alignment-2">4.3.1</a>),
except for two main changes. First, the alignment conditions were manipulated
within subjects. Second, the no NPV condition in the NPV reliability variable
was removed.</p>
<p>The results of Experiment 1 were expected to replicate (see
Section <a href="alignment.html#results-alignment-2">4.3.2</a>). Specifically, it was expected that in the
high alignment condition, participants will be able to respond to each
reliability condition, whereas, in the low alignment condition, they will rely
more on NPV regardless of reliability condition.</p>
<p>In addition to the all-project allocation data analysed above, analyses for just
the “target project” are also reported. This refers to allocation of capital to
the project that had the highest NPV, but the lowest value on concrete measures
intrinsic to the actual product (e.g., the capacity of a laptop in gigabytes).
Therefore, a higher allocation value indicated a higher reliance on NPV.
Further, the method and analyses for the confidence measure are also reported.</p>

<p>A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment,

<p>Experiment 4 found evidence for most of the hypotheses. As per
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2">4.4</a>, laypeople responded
appropriately to verbal reliability instructions in the high alignment
condition. Contrary to
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2">4.5</a>, however,
participants also did this in the low reliability condition. That is, regardless
of the type of project display, participants tended to use NPV more when they
were told that it was reliable and tended to use it less when they were told
that it was unreliable. Further, there was no evidence that this effect was
depended on alignment condition, contrary to
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2">4.3</a>. However,
the linear NPV trend was higher in the high than low alignment condition,
when averaging over reliability level, as predicted in
Hypothesis <a href="alignment.html#hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2">4.2</a>. This suggests that
overall participants still make more use of NPV information when it is hard to
compare between projects.</p>
<p>Hypothesis <a href="alignment-appendix.html#hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1">B.4</a> was not supported, as
there was no evidence of a main effect of alignment on participants’ confidence
in their allocation decisions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the
difference in confidence between reliability conditions was greater in the low
alignment condition. This may reflect participants’ difficulty in making sense
of their choices when alignment was low, given more confidence when assured of
the reliability of NPV. In the high alignment condition, on the other hand,
regardless of reliability condition, they had a way of using the reliability
information. Further, confidence also seemed to increase more with NPV, on
average, more when projects were dissimilar, which provides evidence for their
reliance on NPV in this situation.</p>

<p>Experiment 7 investigated potential ways to facilitate people’s use of variance
in capital allocation. Arguably, people’s decisions should depend on variance,
especially with a small set of projects. That is, when considering between two
potential measures to use for capital allocation, measures with narrow ranges
should be relied upon more than those with wider ranges. As such, this
experiment presented participants with the same capital allocation scenario as
in Experiment 2, but only in low numerical reliability displays. Experiment 7
varied both the variance associated with NPV, and the extent to which
participants were explicitly hinted to use the variance information. It was
predicted that participants’ allocations would be more likely to be informed by
variance when told explicitly to do so with increased salience for variance,
than when only salience is increase, or when no hint is given.</p>

<p>Experiment 7 found that explicitly telling participants how to use variance
information to inform their allocations did not help them do so. However,
there was an increased reliance on NPV with more hints in the ranking data. This
suggests that the hint manipulations potentially simply increase participants’
attention to NPV. It is possible that the study was under-powered, as there was
substantial variance in both the allocation and ranking data. Future work should
attempt to replicate this experiment with a larger sample.</p>

<p>Experiment 8 tested the alignment and reliability effects found in the previous
experiments, while addressing their limitations. Experiments 1 and 4 found a
verbal reliability effect. That is, laypeople allocated more capital to a high
NPV project, depending on how reliable they were told NPV was as a measure.
Experiment 2 found a lack of a numerical reliability effect. That is, business
students allocated an equivalent amount of capital to projects associated with a
high variance NPV, as projects with a low NPV. Testing these two effects in two
different populations did not account for potential expertise effects. As such,
Experiment 8 tested both effects with a naive sample. Further, Experiment 8 used
projects whose features more clearly indicate their profitability, and included
more project domains.</p>

<p>Participants saw and responded to four webpage displays. At the top of each
display was a text preamble, and underneath this a table that contained project
descriptions. The two columns to the right of each description contained text
boxes for participants to enter a value for the project ranking and budget
allocation. Alignment was manipulated by asking participants to either compare
between each of the project pairs (high alignment), or across all eight projects
in the display (low alignment). For instance, in the high alignment display,
participants had to compare between two railway projects, and then separately
between two logistics projects, etc. However, in the low alignment display,
participants had to compare railway projects to logistics projects directly.
This was manipulated within-subjects, such that project descriptions were
identical across alignment conditions and only the type of comparison (and the
associated preamble text) varied.</p>

<p>The value of each type of reliability was also manipulated. Explicit reliability
was manipulated by varying whether participants were told that a project pair
was in an industry in which NPV is considered a reliable or unreliable measure.
Implicit reliability was manipulated by presenting NPVs alongside numerical
ranges instead of verbal reliability information about them, and varying whether
the range was high or low. Both of these were manipulated within-display, such
that NPV was reliable for four projects in each display, and NPV was unreliable
for the other four.</p>
<p>Each project had an associated NPV, which was crossed with each project pair’s
intrinsic features. That is, each pair had one project with a high NPV and low
intrinsic feature values, and one project with a low NPV and high intrinsic
feature values. As such, a reliance on NPV was inferred if participants
allocated the high NPV project more capital, or a reliance on the intrinsic
features if participants allocated the low NPV project more capital.</p>

<p>Experiment 8 found that when variance was presented verbally, participants
allocated according to the reliability information, for both low and high
alignment conditions. When variance was presented numerically, there were no
differences in allocations, for both low and high alignment conditions. Further,
there was an effect of NPV in low reliability for the high alignment condition,
but not the low alignment condition. This effect shows that people still relied
on NPV more than they should when comparing across dissimilar projects.</p>
<p>This experiment shows that similar to the previous experiments, when controlling
for presentation and domain, people still find it easier to allocate capital
based on explicit reliability information when projects are comparable. However,
due to the difference in scale across alignment conditions, a direct alignment
effect was more difficult to test than with the previous experiments. Further,
similar to Experiment 2, Experiment 8 showed that people without much business
experience also struggle to use range information in capital allocation to such
an extreme extent that they do not seem to be using any coherent allocation
strategy.</p>
