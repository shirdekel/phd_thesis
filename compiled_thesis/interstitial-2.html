<p>Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> found that people do not sufficiently perceive the
importance of numerical variance information in capital allocation. This is
important when business projects are dissimilar because people may fail to pay
attention to the differing variance underlying NPV across different domains.
However, there are also implications for high alignment scenarios. When projects
are alignable, managers are likely to be able to use abstract metrics as well as
intrinsic project features. Managers may use a metric such as NPV, the variance
of which may suggest a lack of reliability, despite being able to use intrinsic
project features. Therefore, they may miss the opportunity to use different and
potentially more reliable measures.</p>
<p>Therefore, the evaluation of a non-alignable set of projects has many potential
pitfalls. This situation is likely to occur in most hierarchical organisations,
especially those that are highly diversified. As discussed in
Chapter <a href="interstitial-1.html#interstitial-1">3</a>, a solution for managers who fail to aggregate the
risk of multiple projects may be for them to concurrently evaluate projects as a
portfolio. However, the solution to the evaluation of dissimilar projects in
diversified organisations is likely to involve significantly more difficult
structural changes in the organisation. For instance, this may mean divesting
certain divisions of the organisation, as GE has done in the last few years
<span class="citation">(Scott, <a href="#ref-scott2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Other solutions are also possible. For instance, organisations may develop a
more normative use of metrics and take into account underlying uncertainties.
However, this change may require substantially more statistical reasoning
abilities than should be expected of managers without better decision-making
guidelines. Another solution for managers is to seek evidence from similar
projects from outside of the organisation. This may be useful because a
diversified organisation may not have enough points of reference for a project
proposal. It would also mean that substantial organisational restructuring such
as divestment or training managers in statistical reasoning would not be
required.</p>
<p>Evidence from similar projects may come in the form of an individual case study
from another organisation or a research report that describes a statistical
result. Case studies are especially important in managerial decision-making
because they are used extensively in business school teaching materials.
Therefore, managers are likely to seek case studies that may be used to inform
their decisions. However, do they believe that a single case study is more
useful than statistical data? The literature on anecdotal bias suggests that
they might. Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> considers the influence of anecdotes on
project allocation when they conflict with statistical evidence.</p>
<p>Previous work shows that people often do not give evidence appropriate weighting
in their decisions <span class="citation">(Griffin &amp; Tversky, <a href="#ref-griffin1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>. Statistical and anecdotal evidence often
conflict because statistical estimates commonly refer to the mean value of a
distribution, while individual cases may be sampled from either tail of the
distribution. This comparison may produce conflicting information, especially if
the distribution is skewed; therefore, it is important to appropriately weigh
their influence when making a decision. In the same way that intrinsic project
features conflicted with the abstract financial metrics in
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, anecdotal evidence conflicts with financial metrics of
the target project in Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> considers how people deal with such conflicting
information. That is, do they focus on one metric or use a trade-off? In the
previous chapter, participants did not appear to predominantly use any one
specific cue. The fact that those in the low alignment condition relied more on
NPV compared with those in the high alignment condition means that the latter
were still referring to intrinsic project features to some extent. Specifically,
the influence of different measures may have been integrated in a type of
trade-off. However, there was no clear way of determining this because the
allocation measure was aggregated in the analysis. In Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>,
however, conditions are set up so that it is possible to determine whether
participants were using anecdotes exclusively, partially, or not at all.</p>
