</h1>
<p>Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> found that people do not sufficiently weigh the
importance of numerical variance information in resource allocation. This is
important for when projects are dissimilar because the results showed that
people rely more on NPV in low alignment. Not paying attention to the underlying
variance obscures uncertainty inherent in the measure. When projects are similar
this means that managers may miss out on an opportunity to use different,
potentially more reliable measures. Such measures are more likely to be
available in alignable comparisons. This again many mean another unnecessary use
of an unreliable measure.</p>
<p>An evaluation of a non-alignable set of projects can therefore lead to many
potential pitfalls. Such a situation is likely to occur in most hierarchical
organisations and be more common the more the organisation is diversified. In
Chapter <a href="interstitial-1.html#interstitial-1">3</a> I discussed that an organisation that may realise
the benefits of evaluating projects concurrently can change the frequency of
project evaluation meetings to facilitate a portfolio approach. However, in the
case of a diversified organisation, increasing the alignment between the
projects being evaluated is likely to involve significantly more difficult
structural changes in the organisation. For instance, this may mean divesting
certain divisions of the organisation, as General Electric has been doing over
the last few years. Therefore, without enough points of reference for a project
proposal within an organisation, managers may look to evidence from similar
projects from outside the organisation.</p>
<p>Such evidence may include an individual case study from another organisation, or
research report that describes a statistical result. Case studies are especially
important in managerial decision-making since they are used extensively in
business school teaching materials. Therefore, managers are likely to look to
case studies to inform their decisions. But would they think that a single case
study is more useful than statistical data? The literature on anecdotal bias
suggests that they might. Therefore, Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> considers the
influence of an anecdote on project allocation when it conflicts with
statistical evidence.</p>
<p>Previous worked showed that people often do not always give evidence appropriate
weighting in their decisions <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-griffin1992" role="doc-biblioref">Griffin &amp; Tversky, 1992</a>)</span>. Therefore I investigated the role
of anecdotal and statistical evidence, which are potentially conflicting sources
of evidence. This is possible since statistical estimates commonly refer to the
mean value of a distribution, whereas individual cases may be sampled, for
instance, from either of the tails of the distribution. This comparison would
give the appearance of conflicting information, especially if the distribution
is skewed. In the same way that in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> the intrinsic
project features conflicted with the abstract financial metric, in
Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> the description of an anecdote conflicted with the
financial metrics of the target project.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> also considered how people dealt with such conflicting
information. That is, would they focus on one metric or use a trade-off? In the
previous chapter, people did not seem to predominantly use one cue or another.
The fact that those in the low alignment condition relied on NPV more than those
in the high alignment condition means that those in the high alignment condition
were still referring to the intrinsic project features to some extent.
Specifically, the different measures’ influence may have been integrated in a
form of trade-off. However, there was no clear way of determining this, because
the allocation measure was aggregated in the analysis. In
Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>, however, I set up the conditions such that it was
possible to determine whether participants were using anecdotes exclusively,
partially, or not at all.</p>
