</h1>
<p>This thesis investigated the psychology of capital allocation decisions. The
influence of psychological factors on such decisions has not been sufficiently
considered in the literature despite their importance to the performance of
hierarchical organisations. This discrepancy is likely due to a greater focus of
the role of organisational influences on firm performance in the management
literature. The thesis did not investigate expertise effects, but instead
focused largely on participants without management experience. This allowed a
study of the specific cognitive processes without the potential confound of
experience. Though, it is also worth noting that, in the one case where the work
examined people with management experience, the pattern of results was largely
the same as with naive participants. Each of the empirical chapters investigated
distinct but related processes that are relevant to the capital allocation
process. These chapters investigated whether people were able to account for the
benefits of aggregation when considering multiple projects
(Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a>), the influence of project feature alignability and
metric variance when comparing projects directly (Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>), and
the influence of project anecdote similarity when the anecdote conflicts with
statistical evidence (Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>).
Section <a href="discussion.html#summary-of-results">7.1</a> will first summarise the results of the
empirical chapters, and Sections <a href="aggregation.html#theoretical-implications">2.4.1</a>
and <a href="aggregation.html#practical-implications">2.4.2</a> will then discuss their theoretical and
practical implications, respectively. Section <a href="discussion.html#conclusion">7.4</a> will conclude
the thesis.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Summary of Results<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-of-results"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> investigated participants’ choice of risky business
projects, when these are displayed sequentially and without feedback in between
decisions. This design modelled the real-life situation that managers face in
hierarchical organisations: an evaluation of a set of separate business project
proposals over time with no immediate indication of the performance of those
projects. Aggregating a portfolio of such projects is likely to show a lower
chance of potential loss overall than might be originally assumed. The results
from this chapter showed that people not only did not do this spontaneously, but
also were not facilitated by manipulations that encouraged grouping choices
together as a portfolio. People only seemed to recognise the benefits of
aggregation when they were presented with an outcome probability distribution of
the aggregated set of projects. There was no strong evidence that more subtle
manipulations aimed at encouraging aggregation worked. Specifically, presenting
projects together, specifying the total number of projects, and presenting
projects that were all from the same industry did not reliably encourage
aggregation.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> investigated capital allocation when projects were
evaluated jointly and capital was allocated as a proportion of the budget,
rather than a binary choice. The main manipulation was whether all the project
attributes were alignable, or only the abstract financial metric (NPV) was
alignable. NPV was also manipulated to be considered as either a reliable metric
or not. This information was expressed either as explicit verbal instruction or
as numerical ranges. The results showed that when reliability information was
presented verbally, participants used NPV appropriately when all project
attributes were completely alignable. That is, they used it when it was reliable
and used the intrinsic project features when it was unreliable. When only NPV
was alignable, participants relied on it almost exclusively. However, when
reliability information was presented numerically, participants’ allocation did
not depend on the ranges—participants used NPV even when they had an
opportunity to use the intrinsic features of the project. Overall, however,
participants relied on NPV more when projects were low in alignment than when
they were high in alignment.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> investigated the effect of anecdote similarity on
allocations when the anecdote conflicted with the statistical data. Participants
were asked to allocate a hypothetical budget between two projects. One of the
projects (the target project) was clearly superior in terms of the provided
statistical measures, but some of the participants also saw a description of a
project with a conflicting outcome (the anecdotal project). This anecdotal
project was always in the same industry as the target project. The anecdote
description, however, either contained substantive connections to the target or
not. Further, the anecdote conflicted with the statistical measures because it
was either successful (positive anecdote) or unsuccessful (negative anecdote).
The results showed that participants’ decisions were influenced by anecdotes
only when they believed that they were actually relevant to the target project.
Further, they still incorporated the statistical measures into their decision.
This was found for both positive and negative anecdotes. Further, participants
were given information about the way that the anecdotes were sampled that
suggested that the statistical information should have been used in all cases.
Participants did not use this information in their decisions and still showed an
anecdotal bias effect. Therefore, people seem to appropriately use anecdotes
based on their relevance, but do not understand the implications of certain
statistical concepts.</p>
<p>Together, these results show the bounds of people’s decision-making capability
in capital allocation. The participants in these experiments in general behaved
rationally but struggled to incorporate certain statistical concepts into their
decisions. Further, when confronted with multi-attribute choice, participants
tended to allocate capital using a trade-off strategy. This was seen in the
conflict between intrinsic project attributes and NPV in
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> and the conflict between the anecdotal and statistical
evidence in Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>. Participants’ allocations were informed by
relevant factors when these were sufficiently clear (as in the verbal
reliability condition in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>). However, participants
struggled to do this when the factor involved using a relatively basic
statistical concept. Each empirical chapter included such a concept: risk
aggregation in Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a>, metric variance in
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, and sample distribution in Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>.
The aggregated distribution in Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> and the verbal
reliability manipulation in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> showed that a formal
understanding of such concepts is not always necessary if they are expressed
explicitly.</p>
<p>The statistical concepts used in these studies are all likely accessible for
people without much formal mathematical knowledge. A basic concept of risk
aggregation is clearly available to laypeople as seen in the responses to
multi-play gambles (e.g., one vs. 100 gambles). Further, people certainly have a
basic understanding of numerical ranges and that a wider range means more
spread. Despite likely having this understanding, participants in the above
experiments were unable to use it in the decisions. Similarly, other work has
shown that generalisations are sensitive to sampling <span class="citation">(Carvalho et al., <a href="#ref-carvalho2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. Therefore,
it is unlikely that the people in the thesis experiments simply lacked any
understanding of these statistical concepts or (at least sensitivity to this
kind of information). Instead there appear to be important contextual factors
that critically support or prevent people from showing their intuitive
understanding. Unfortunately, the methods used in this thesis more closely
resemble real decisions managers make than the prior research that showed people
do reason with these kinds of statistical concepts. Further, it is not clear
that these effects will simply disappear with just more maths knowledge and
business experience. Previous work showed that expertise does not always remove
biases and in some cases it seems to augment such effects <span class="citation">(e.g., Haigh &amp; List, <a href="#ref-haigh2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Theoretical Implications<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#theoretical-implications"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The main theoretical contribution of this thesis is the addition of evidence
that further specifies the conditions under which people make rational decisions
in capital allocation scenarios. People made good decisions most of the time,
but sometimes do not use relevant information in their decisions. Amos Tversky
explained in his response to <span class="citation">Cohen (<a href="#ref-cohen1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981</a>, p. 355)</span> that the work on heuristics and
biases “portrayed people as fallible, not irrational.” That is, people are not
constantly making mistakes, but often behave rationally, largely due to adaptive
heuristics. However, sometimes shortcuts that are usually helpful can fail.
Studying such biases is similar to the way that optical illusions help
understand the visual system. In both cases, these are systems that most of the
time function properly, but sometimes reveal deficits.</p>
<p>Similarly, <span class="citation">Simon (<a href="#ref-simon1955" role="doc-biblioref">1955</a>)</span> identified human rationality as <em>bounded</em>, meaning that
people’s cognitive processes are limited. The main aim of the thesis was to
contribute evidence for the ways that capital allocation decisions are bounded.
To this end, in each experiment, participants were given capital allocation
scenarios alongside both cues that describe their options and cues that frame
the options in different ways. Identifying which cues were used by participants
in their decisions, which cues were ignored, and which cues were integrated
allowed to specify the bounds of people’s cognitive capacity in these decisions.
The experiments showed that people struggle to use certain statistical concepts
in their decisions, but that they are also capable of making nuanced trade-offs
and can be assisted by decision aides. Understanding how decision-making in
capital allocation is constrained and biased is important in order to improve
decision-making. Even if decisions are largely consistent with normative
concepts, falling prey to the biases identified in this thesis can have severe
consequences for organisations.</p>

</h3>
<p>Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> presented participants with a capital allocation
situation in which an understanding of risk aggregation would have led to
beneficial outcomes. Investing in all the hypothetical projects would have led
to a much higher chance of gaining money than losing any. Each choice bracketing
manipulation provided a hint of the possibility of combining the choices in this
way. However, participants did not need to compute the aggregated value of the
prospects themselves. An intuitive understanding of aggregation involved
considering that some of the gambles will pay-off and make up for those that
lost. However, this was not seen, with only weak evidence that people were
influenced by the more subtle choice bracketing manipulations. Instead, people
only seemed to respond to the concept of aggregation when it was explicitly
showcased. Showing people a distribution of the outcome probabilities explicitly
visualised the extent to which an aggregation of the risks can lead to an
incredibly low chance of loss.</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, the NPVs that participants saw were critical to the
allocation task. In the low alignment condition, NPV was the only alignable
attribute in the comparison. In the high alignment condition, however, NPV was
in competition with the intrinsic project feature values. An understanding of
how to use numerical variance would have allowed participants to allocate
capital according to the implied reliability of the comparison metric. In the
low alignment condition, NPV was the only easy way to compare across projects,
so it was a more useful cue than the rest of the non-alignable values. However,
in the high alignment condition, the extent of numerical variance associated
with each NPV could have been used to determine NPV reliability. There were two
ways to do this: (a) noticing that in the low numerical reliability condition
the ranges were all overlapping, and (b) noticing the difference in the width of
the ranges between the two within-subjects reliability level conditions. By
doing this, participants would have then been able to know to (in the high
alignment condition) use NPV when ranges were narrow and use the intrinsic
values more or exclusively when ranges were wider and overlapping. Participants
were able to do this sort of conditional allocation when reliability was
expressed explicitly as words, but not when it was expressed numerically.</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>, participants did not make use of descriptive
information about the anecdote sample distribution. As in
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, participants were confronted with a conflict of cues:
statistical information vs. a potentially relevant anecdote. Regardless of the
similarity manipulation, a consideration of the sample from which the anecdote
was sampled should have informed how the anecdote was used. Imagine a
distribution that represents the similarity of all the individual projects in
the sample. That is, the x-axis represents the similarity to the target project
and the y-axis is the frequency of projects that represent each level of
similarity. Even if the sampled anecdote appears very relevant to the target
project, if the underlying distribution of the sample is highly negatively
skewed, such that most projects in the sample are equivalently similar to the
target, then the sampled anecdote is not necessarily more informative than the
aggregated measure. On the other hand, if the underlying distribution is
positively skewed, normally distributed, or even uniform, then the fact that the
sampled anecdote appears highly relevant to the target project may actually mean
that it is more informative than the aggregated measure. Prior work shows that
people can reason about distributions effectively when experiencing the sampling
directly <span class="citation">(e.g., Hertwig et al., <a href="#ref-hertwig2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>; Carvalho et al., <a href="#ref-carvalho2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> shows
that people struggle to use this information when it is described verbally.</p>
<p>While people struggled to understand and use certain statistical concepts they
still seemed to be able to integrate multiple cues and create trade-offs. As
discussed in Chapter <a href="interstitial-2.html#interstitial-2">5</a>, both Chapters <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>
and <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> provided participants with more than one cue to use for
project evaluation. In Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, people seemed to strike a
trade-off between NPV and the intrinsic project features as opposed to choosing
one or the other with a consistent strategy. In Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>, the
anecdotal and statistical evidence provided conflicting cues for each target
project. However, participants allocated as if both the anecdotes and statistics
had some relevance. Similar to the above, participants appeared to integrate the
influence of these two cues, as opposed to picking a consistent evidence
reliance strategy for their allocation decisions. These findings might be
explained through satisficing <span class="citation">(Simon, <a href="#ref-simon1955" role="doc-biblioref">1955</a>)</span> or a constraint satisfaction model
<span class="citation">(e.g., Glöckner et al., <a href="#ref-glockner2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Future research can test these explanations, as well as
further clarify to what extent constructs such as need for cognition or
mathematical skill may explain individual differences.</p>

<p>While trade-offs allow people to integrate multiple cues, decision aides allow
people to use statistical concepts for more nuanced decision-making.
Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> found that people’s understanding of risk aggregation
was facilitated when the mathematical work was done for them and the aggregated
values were displayed visually as a distribution. However, a follow-up
experiment to Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> (detailed in Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-6">B.7</a>)
found that even explicit instructions sometimes do not work. That is, even
explaining the way that ranges can be used as reliability information and
telling participants how to implement this in the capital allocation task did
not facilitate proper use of ranges.</p>
<p>Future work should investigate the impact of visualisation on people’s use of
variance information in these situations. Much work has investigated visualising
uncertainty information <span class="citation">(Bostrom et al., <a href="#ref-bostrom2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Brodlie et al., <a href="#ref-brodlie2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Davis &amp; Keller, <a href="#ref-davis1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>; Johnson &amp; Sanderson, <a href="#ref-johnson2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Kinkeldey et al., <a href="#ref-kinkeldey2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>; Kox, <a href="#ref-kox2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Lapinski, <a href="#ref-lapinski2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Lipkus, <a href="#ref-lipkus2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>; Lipkus &amp; Hollands, <a href="#ref-lipkus1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>; MacEachren, <a href="#ref-maceachren1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>; Padilla et al., <a href="#ref-padilla2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Pang et al., <a href="#ref-pang1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>; Potter et al., <a href="#ref-potter2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Ristovski et al., <a href="#ref-ristovski2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Spiegelhalter et al., <a href="#ref-spiegelhalter2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Torsney-Weir et al., <a href="#ref-torsneyweir2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. For instance, a Hypothetical Outcome Plot
<span class="citation">(Hullman et al., <a href="#ref-hullman2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Kale et al., <a href="#ref-kale2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> expresses variance information as dynamic plots and is
one method that is likely to be beneficial to people’s understanding of ranges
as used in this thesis. Visualisation could also apply to the work in
Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>. Using a visual array as in <span class="citation">Jaramillo et al. (<a href="#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> is likely to
facilitate people’s understanding of the importance of statistical evidence over
anecdotes. However, an additional visualisation of the distribution of the
underlying similarity to the target may also be necessary to facilitate
understanding of the relevance of the sample distribution. Ultimately,
visualisations of the effects of certain statistical concepts may be necessary
for people to use them appropriately.</p>

</h3>
<p>The boundary between the cues that participants were able to use and the
statistical concepts that they did not use is unclear. That is, the cues that
they were able to use were not trivial, and the concepts that they were not able
to use are relatively basic. For instance, the finding in
Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> that people were able to use relevance information to
guide their allocations shows an ability to quite specific information to inform
choice. On the other hand, the statistical concepts that participants ignored in
each empirical chapter are all relatively intuitive. While concepts of
aggregation, variance, and sample distribution are typically studied at a
tertiary level, they can be understood when acted out or experienced.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Clark and Karmilff-Smith (<a href="#ref-clark1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span> proposed a distinction between two levels of representing knowledge.
At the <em>implicit</em> level an individual can only make use of a certain system of
knowledge, while it is only at the <em>explicit</em> level that they develop insight
into that system. For instance, young children can use closed class words such
as “the” or “to”, but only identify them as words later in development. Further,
children’s play often implicitly contains many mathematical concepts, despite
the children’s struggle to explicitly reason with the exact same concepts in
more formal problem-solving <span class="citation">(Sarama &amp; Clements, <a href="#ref-sarama2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. Adults may have a similar distinction
in knowledge representation. Concepts that can be used when experienced
directly, such as in risky choice from experience, are not represented in a way
that they can be used when presented descriptively, such as in risky choice from
description. This kind of distinction may explain why participants in the thesis
experiments failed to use concepts that have been shown to be accessible to
laypeople.</p>

</h3>
<p>Future research should investigate the potential expertise effects that may
influence the findings of the thesis. This is important because of the potential
downstream effects of biased managerial decision-making. For instance, it is
unclear to what extent psychological factors such as the ones discussed in this
thesis may account for the finding that undiversified firms often perform better
than diversified firms. On the one hand, business professionals tend to work
with numbers, so the effects found in this thesis may be less pronounced for
them. For instance, <span class="citation">Smith and Kida (<a href="#ref-smith1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span> reviewed the heuristics and biases literature and
concluded that certain cognitive biases are not as strong for accounting
professionals as they are for naive participants.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these effects may actually be stronger in managers. For
instance, <span class="citation">Haigh and List (<a href="#ref-haigh2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> found that professional traders show more myopic loss
aversion than students. Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> showed that people tend to
consider risky choices one at a time and therefore tend to be more risk averse

might be even more risk averse in these situations because of the increased
stakes for their jobs. <span class="citation">Lovallo et al. (<a href="#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> discussed the ways in which managers tend to

<p>Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> found evidence of variance neglect for both laypeople
and Master of Management students. Further, in the case of the work in
Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>, it is possible that business managers prefer anecdotal
cases to inform their decisions because of their higher salience, compared to
statistical data. Managers are also more likely to feel as if the situation is
relevant to them, which acording to <span class="citation">Freling et al. (<a href="#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> would predict more anecdotal

</h2>
<p>The findings of this thesis have a number of potential implications for
managerial decision-making. Despite the uncertainty about potential expertise
effects, this section assumes that the findings of the thesis generalise to
experienced managers, if not in degree, at least qualitatively. Management
researchers have suggested ways of overcoming psychological biases in managerial
decision-making ever since such biases were identified. Many
practitioner-oriented papers have used the findings of the judgement and
uncertainty literature both to explain managerial decision-making processes and
to suggest ways of reducing bias <span class="citation">(Courtney et al., <a href="#ref-courtney1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>, <a href="#ref-courtney2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Hall et al., <a href="#ref-hall2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Koller et al., <a href="#ref-koller2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Lovallo &amp; Sibony, <a href="#ref-lovallo2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Sibony et al., <a href="#ref-sibony2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, with only some specifically focused
on capital allocation decisions <span class="citation">(Birshan et al., <a href="#ref-birshan2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. This section will review some of
the implications the findings of this thesis may have on both organisational
policies and manager decision-making.</p>
<p>The findings of Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> show that the framing of business
project proposals is important for the way that people perceive their risk.
Specifically, in order to better account for the risks of business projects it
is important to (a) make it easier for managers to group projects together, and
(b) aggregate a portfolio of projects for them. This suggests implementing
organisational changes that will facilitate the capital allocation process. For
instance, <span class="citation">Lovallo et al. (<a href="#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> suggested that companies change the frequency that they
evaluate projects to better allow for an aggregation of the projects. Doing this
will enable an explicit computation of the aggregated values and therefore a
visualisation of the outcome probability distribution. Such a process could
facilitate aggregation without a need to rely on managers’ intuition during
sequential project evaluation decisions.</p>
<p>One implication of Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> is that it is important to expose
the variance that underlies abstract financial measures. Further, translating
such numerical variance estimates into clear verbal information would help
facilitate managers’ understanding and implementation of such estimates.
Organisational changes could include reducing diversification so that there is
less reliance on abstract metrics. This would allow for more of a comparison
between alignable project attributes, potentially reducing forecast error.
<span class="citation">Koller et al. (<a href="#ref-koller2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> found that companies with more similar business units report faster
growth and greater profitability than competitors, compared with companies with
dissimilar business units. Further, companies can also work to develop better
metrics and establish norms about how much to discount a metric given its
underlying variance.</p>
<p>The main implication of Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> is that managers should pay
attention to the way that they compare target projects to other cases. It is
important to collect prior cases that are relevant, and to have as many such
cases as possible. Ideally, each such prior case should be weighed by similarity
<span class="citation">(Lovallo et al., <a href="#ref-lovallo2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. If this is done, the prior distribution of the similarity of the
sample would be taken into account when computing subsequent aggregation. When
identifying such similarity ratings, it is important to focus on relevant
underlying structure. This would reduce any erroneous connections to cases that
only have a mere surface similarity. This distinction is also relevant in a
situation in which only one prior case can be found. Research on analogy shows
that analogical comparison helps expose the underlying relational structure
between objects <span class="citation">(e.g., Kurtz et al., <a href="#ref-kurtz2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Markman &amp; Gentner, <a href="#ref-markman1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>. Therefore, managers should
take care to first identify such relational structures first before making
subsequent inferences.</p>
<p>Addressing these psychological effects will help eliminate some of the biases in
the capital allocation process, but will not address other related biases. For
instance, the above effects all involve decisions that require an evaluation of
financial forecast estimates such as future cash flows and the related
uncertainty. Therefore, a further source of error could arise from the initial
estimation of these probability and cash flow values. For instance, such
estimates could be influenced by optimism or confidence biases. These biases,
however, can in turn also be addressed <span class="citation">(Flyvbjerg et al., <a href="#ref-flyvbjerg2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

</h2>
<p>Capital allocation decisions are consequential for large organisations. This
thesis tested the conditions under which people behave rationally or are
fallible when allocating capital. The experiments found that participants
struggle to incorporate concepts such as risk aggregation, estimate variance,
and sample distribution into their decisions. Participants only seemed to be
able to do this when the concept was expressed visually very explicitly.
However, when there were multiple cues for choice evaluation, the results also
showed that participants were capable of integrating conflicting information in
their decisions. Identifying such cognitive bounds helps to better understand
how people evaluate multiple choices and helps future research develop methods
to facilitate better decisions.</p>
