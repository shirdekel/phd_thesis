<p>This thesis investigated the psychology of resource allocation decisions. The
influence of psychological factors on such decisions has not been sufficiently
considered in the literature despite its importance to the performance of
hierarchical organisations. This discrepancy is likely due to a greater focus of
the role of organisational influences on firm performance in the management
literature. The thesis did not investigate expertise effects, but instead
focused largely on participants without management experience. This allowed a
study of the specific cognitive processes without the potential confound of
experience. Each of the empirical chapters investigated distinct but related
processes that are relevant to the resource allocation process. By doing this I
was able to investigate whether people are able to account for the benefits of
aggregation when considering multiple projects (Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a>), the
influence of project feature alignability and metric variance when comparing
projects directly (Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>), and the influence of project
anecdote similarity when the anecdote conflicts with statistical evidence
(Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>). I will first summarise the results of the empirical
chapters and then discuss their theoretical and practical implications.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Summary of results<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-of-results"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> investigated the choice of risky business projects
that are displayed sequentially and without feedback. This design modelled the
real-life situation that managers are faced with in hierarchical organisations:
an evaluation of a set of separate business project proposals over time with no
immediate indication of the performance of those projects. Aggregating a
portfolio of such projects is likely to show a lower chance of potential loss
overall than might be originally assumed. The results from this chapter showed
that people not only did not do this spontaneously, but also were not
facilitated by manipulations that encouraged grouping choices together as a
portfolio. People only seemed to recognise the benefits of aggregation when they
were presented with an outcome probability distribution of the aggregated set of
projects. There was no strong evidence that more subtle manipulations aimed at
encouraging aggregation worked. Specifically, presenting projects together,
specifying the total number of projects, and presenting projects that were all
from the same industry did not encourage aggregation.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> investigated resource allocation when projects were
evaluated jointly and capital was allocated as a proportion of the budget,
rather than a binary choice. I manipulated whether all the project attributes
were alignable, or only the abstract financial metric (NPV) was alignable. I
also manipulated whether NPV was to be considered a reliable metric or not, and
whether this information was expressed as explicit verbal instruction or as
numerical ranges. The results showed that when reliability information was
presented verbally, participants used it appropriately when all project
attributes were completely alignable. That is, they used it when it was reliable
and used the intrinsic project features when it was unreliable. When only NPV
was alignable, participants relied on it regardless of the reliability
information. However, when reliability information was presented numerically,
there was no moderation of allocation based on the ranges—participants used
NPV even when they had an opportunity to use the intrinsic features of the
project. Overall, however, participants tended to rely on NPV more in the low
alignment condition than in the high alignment condition.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> investigated the effect of anecdote similarity on
allocations when anecdote conflicted with statistical data. Participants were
asked to allocate a hypothetical budget between two projects. One of the
projects was clearly superior in terms of the provided statistical measures, but
some of the participants also saw a description of a project with a conflicting
outcome. This anecdotal project was always in the same industry as one of the
target projects. However, the anecdote description either contained substantive
connections to the target or not. I also manipulated whether the anecdote
conflicted with the statistical measures because it was successful (positive
anecdote) or unsuccessful (negative anecdote). The results showed that
participants’ decisions were influenced by anecdotes only when they believed
that they were actually relevant to the target project. Further, they still
incorporated the statistical measures into their decision. I found this for both
positive and negative anecdotes. However, participants were given information
about the way that the anecdotes were sampled that suggested that the
statistical information should have been used in all cases. Participants did not
use this information in their decision and still showed an anecdotal bias
effect. Therefore, people seem to appropriately moderate their use of anecdotes
based on the anecdotes’ relevance, but do not understand the implications of
more complex statistical principles.</p>
<p>Together, these results show the bounds of people’s decision-making capability
in resource allocation. The participants in these experiments in general behaved
rationally but struggled to incorporate more advanced statistical principles
into their decisions. Further, when confronted with multi-attribute choice,
participants tended to allocate resources using a trade-off strategy. This was
seen in the conflict between intrinsic project attributes and NPV in
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> and the conflict between the anecdotal and statistical
evidence in Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>. Participants were able to moderate their
allocations when the moderating factors were sufficiently clear (as in the
verbal reliability condition in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>). However, participants
struggled to do this when the moderating factor involved an understanding of a
more advanced statistical principle. Each empirical chapter included such a
principle: risk aggregation in Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a>, metric variance in
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, and sample distribution in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>.
However, a formal understanding of such principles does not seem to be necessary
if they are expressed explicitly (as in the aggregated distribution in
Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Theoretical implications<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#theoretical-implications-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The main theoretical contribution of this thesis is the addition of evidence
that further specifies the conditions under which people make rational decisions
in resource allocation scenarios. People made good decisions most of the time,
but sometimes do not take into account important moderating factors in their
decisions. Amos Tversky explained in his response to <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-cohen1981" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-cohen1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981, p. 355</a>)</span> that
the work on heuristics and biases “portrayed people as fallible, not
irrational.” That is, people are not constantly making mistakes, but often
behave rationally, largely due to adaptive heuristics. However, sometimes
shortcuts that are usually helpful can fail. Studying such biases is similar to
the way that optical illusions help understand the visual system. In both cases,
these are systems that most of the time function properly, but sometimes reveal
deficits.</p>
<p>Similarly, <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-simon1955" role="doc-biblioref">Simon</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-simon1955" role="doc-biblioref">1955</a>)</span> identified human rationality as <em>bounded</em>, meaning that
people’s cognitive processes are limited. The main aim of the thesis was to
contribute evidence for the ways that resource allocation decisions are bounded.
To this end, in each experiment, participants were given resource allocation
scenarios alongside both cues that describe their options and cues that frame
the options in different ways. Identifying which cues were used by participants
in their decisions, which cues were ignored, and which cues were integrated
allowed to specify the bounds of people’s cognitive capacity in these decisions.
The experiments showed that people struggle to use certain statistical
principles in their decisions, but that they are also capable of making nuanced
trade-offs and can be assisted by decision aides.</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> I presented participants with a resource
allocation situation in which an understanding of risk aggregation would have
led to beneficial outcomes. Investing in all the hypothetical projects would
have led to a much higher chance of gaining money than losing any. Each choice
bracketing manipulation provided a hint of the possibility of combining the
choices in this way. However, participants did not need to compute the
aggregated value of the prospects themselves. An intuitive understanding of
aggregation involved considering that of all the gambles some will pay-off and
make up for those that lost. However, this was not seen, with only weak evidence
that people were influenced by the more subtle choice bracketing manipulations.
Instead, people only seemed to respond to the principle of aggregation when it
was explicitly showcased. Showing people a distribution of the outcome
probabilities explicitly visualised the extent to which an aggregation of the
risks can lead to an incredibly low chance of loss.</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> the NPVs that participants saw were critical to the
allocation task. In the low alignment condition, NPV was the only alignable
attribute in the comparison. In the high alignment condition, however, NPV was
in competition with the intrinsic project feature values. An understanding of
numerical variance would have allowed participants to moderate their allocations
according to the implied reliability of the comparison metric. In the low
alignment condition, NPV was the only easy way to compare across projects, so it
was a more useful cue than the rest of the non-alignable values. However, in the
high alignment condition, the extent of numerical variance associated with each
NPV could have been used to determine NPV reliability. There were two ways to do
this: 1. noticing that in the low numerical reliability condition the ranges
were all overlapping, and 2. noticing the difference in the width of the ranges
between the two within-subjects reliability amount conditions. By doing this,
participants would have then been able to know to (in the high alignment
condition) use NPV when ranges were narrow and use the intrinsic values more or
exclusively when ranges were wider and overlapping. Participants were able to do
this sort of moderated allocation when reliability was expressed explicitly as
words, but not when it was expressed numerically.</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> participants did not make use of important
information about the sample distribution. As in Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>,
participants were confronted with a conflict of cues: statistical information
vs. a potentially relevant anecdote. Regardless of the similarity manipulation,
a consideration of the sample from which the anecdote was sampled should have
informed how the anecdote was used. Imagine a distribution that represents the
similarity of all the individual projects in the sample. That is, the x-axis
represents the similarity to the target project and the y-axis is the frequency
of projects that represent each level of similarity. Even if the sampled
anecdote appears very relevant to the target project, if the underlying
distribution of the sample is highly negatively skewed, such that most projects
in the sample are equivalently similar to the target, then the sampled anecdote
is not necessarily more informative than the aggregated measure. On the other
hand, if the underlying distribution was negatively skewed, normally
distributed, or even uniform, then the fact that the sampled anecdote appears
highly relevant to the target project may actually mean that it is more
informative than the aggregated measure.</p>
<p>While people struggled to understand and use difficult statistical principles
they still seemed to be able to integrate multiple cues and create trade-offs.
As discussed in Chapter <a href="interstitial-2.html#interstitial-2">5</a>, in both Chapters <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>
and <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> participants were provided with more than one cue to use
for project evaluation. In Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a>, people seemed to strike a
trade-off between NPV and the intrinsic project features as opposed to choosing
one or the other with a consistent strategy. In Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>, the
anecdotal and statistical evidence provided conflicting cues for each target
project. However, participants allocated as if both the anecdotes and statistics
have some relevance. Similar to above, participants appeared to integrate the
influence of these two cues, as opposed to picking a consistent evidence
reliance strategy for their allocation decisions. These findings might be
explained using satisficing <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-simon1955" role="doc-biblioref">Simon, 1955</a>)</span> or a constraint satisfaction model
<span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-glockner2014" role="doc-biblioref">Glöckner et al., 2014</a>)</span>. Future research can test these explanations, as well as
further clarify to what extent constructs such as need for cognition or
mathematical skill explain individual differences.</p>
<p>While trade-offs allow people to integrate multiple cues, decision aides allow
for people to use statistical principles for more complex moderation. In
Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> I found that people’s understanding of risk
aggregation was facilitated when the mathematical work was done for them and the
aggregated values were displayed visually as a distribution. However, in a
follow-up experiment to Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> (detailed in
Appendix <a href="alignment-appendix.html#alignment-6">B.7</a>), I found that even explicit instructions sometimes
do not work. That is, even explaining the way that ranges can be used as
reliability information and telling participants how to implement this in the
resource allocation task did not facilitate proper use of ranges. Future work
should investigate the impact of visualisation on people’s use of variance
information in these situations. Much work has investigated visualising
uncertainty information <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bostrom2008" role="doc-biblioref">Bostrom et al., 2008</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-brodlie2012" role="doc-biblioref">Brodlie et al., 2012</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-davis1997" role="doc-biblioref">T.

understanding of ranges as used in this thesis. HOPs express variance
information as dynamic plots. Visualisation could also apply to the work in
Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>. Using a visual array as in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jaramillo et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-jaramillo2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> is likely to
facilitate people’s understanding of the importance of statistical evidence over
anecdotes. However, an additional visualisation of the distribution of the
underlying similarity to the target might also be necessary to facilitate
understanding of the relevance of the sample distribution. Ultimately, it seems
that visualisations of the effects of complex statistical concepts are often
necessary for people to use them appropriately.</p>
<p>Future research should also investigate the potential expertise effects that may
influence the findings in the thesis. This is important because of the potential
downstream effects that biased managerial decision-making might have. For
instance, it is unclear to what extent psychological factors such as the ones
discussed in this thesis may account for the finding that undiversified firms
perform better than diversified firms. On the one hand, business professionals
tend to work with numbers, so the effects found in this thesis may be less
pronounced for them. For instance, <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-smith1991" role="doc-biblioref">Smith &amp; Kida</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-smith1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span> reviewed the heuristics and biases
literature and concluded that certain cognitive biases are not as strong for
accounting professionals as they are for naive participants.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are reasons to believe that these effects may actually
be stronger in managers. Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> showed that people tend to
consider risky choices one at a time and therefore tend to be more risk averse
to a set of projects than they would be if the risks were aggregated. Managers
might be even more risk averse in these situations because of the increased
stakes for their jobs. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> discussed the ways in which managers tend to
have a blind spot for such project evaluations: they aggregate their personal
stock market portfolio, but not their managerial one. Further,
Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> found evidence of variance neglect for both laypeople
and Masters of Management students. In the case of the work in
Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a>, it might be possible that business managers often
prefer anecdotal accounts to inform their decisions because of their higher
salience, compared to statistical data. Managers are also more likely to feel as
if the situation is relevant to them, which acording to <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">Freling et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-freling2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> would
suggest more anecdotal bias.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Practical implications<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#practical-implications-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The findings of this thesis have a number of potential implications for
managerial decision-making. Despite the uncertainty about potential expertise
effects, in this section I will assume that the findings of this thesis
generalise to experienced managers, if not in degree, at least qualitatively.
Management researchers have suggested ways of overcoming psychological biases in
managerial decision-making ever since such biases were identified. Many
practitioner-oriented papers have used the findings of the judgement and
uncertainty literature both to explain managerial decision-making processes and
to suggest ways of reducing bias <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-courtney2013" role="doc-biblioref">Hugh Courtney et al., 2013</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-courtney1997" role="doc-biblioref">H. Courtney et al., 1997</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-hall2012" role="doc-biblioref">Hall et al., 2012</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-koller2012" role="doc-biblioref">Koller et al., 2012</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2014" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo &amp; Sibony, 2014</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-sibony2017" role="doc-biblioref">Sibony et al., 2017</a>)</span>, with only some specifically focused
on resource allocation decisions <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-birshan2013" role="doc-biblioref">Birshan et al., 2013</a>)</span>. I will now review some of the
implications the findings of this thesis may have on both organisational
policies and manager decision-making.</p>
<p>The findings of Chapter <a href="aggregation.html#aggregation">2</a> show that the way that business
projects are framed is important for the way that people perceive their risk.
Specifically, in order to better account for the risks of business projects it
is important to make it easier for managers to 1. group projects together,
and 2. aggregate a portfolio of projects for them. This suggests implementing
organisational changes that will facilitate the resource allocation process. For
instance, <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> suggested that companies change the frequency that they
evaluate projects to better allow for an aggregation of the projects. Doing this
will enable an explicit computation of the aggregated values and therefore a
visualisation of the outcome probability distribution. Such a process could
facilitate aggregation without a need to rely on managers’ intuition during
sequential project evaluation decisions.</p>
<p>One implication of Chapter <a href="alignment.html#alignment">4</a> is that it is important to expose
the variance underlying abstract financial measures. Further, translating such
numerical variance estimates into clear verbal clear would help facilitate
managers’ understanding and implementation of such estimates. Organisational
changes could include reducing diversification so that there is less reliance on
abstract metrics. This would allow for more of a comparison between alignable
project attributes, potentially reducing forecast error.</p>
<p>The main implication of Chapter <a href="anecdotes.html#anecdotes">6</a> is that managers should pay
attention to the way that they compare target projects to other cases. It is
important to collect prior cases that are relevant, and to have as many such
cases as possible. Ideally, each such prior case should be weighed by similarity
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lovallo2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lovallo et al., 2012</a>)</span>. If this is done, the prior distribution of the similarity of the
sample would be taken into account when computing subsequent aggregation. When
identifying such similarity ratings, it is important to focus on relevant
underlying structure. This would reduce any erroneous connections to cases that
only have a mere surface similarity. This distinction is also relevant in a
situation in which only one prior case can be found. Research on analogy shows
that analogical comparison helps expose the underlying relational structure
between objects <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-kurtz2013" role="doc-biblioref">Kurtz et al., 2013</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-markman1993" role="doc-biblioref">A. B. Markman &amp; Gentner, 1993</a>)</span>. Therefore, managers should
take care to first identify such relational structures first before making
subsequent inferences.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, addressing these psychological effects will help
eliminate some of the biases in the resource allocation process, but will not
address other related biases. For instance, the above effects all involve
decisions that require an evaluation of financial forecast estimates such as
future cash flows and the related uncertainty. Therefore, a further source of
error could arise from the initial estimation of these probability and cash flow
values. For instance, such estimates could be influenced by optimism or
confidence biases, which can in turn be addressed <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-flyvbjerg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Flyvbjerg et al., 2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Resource allocation decisions can be consequential for large organisations.
Therefore, this thesis tested the conditions under which people behave
rationally or are fallible when allocating resources. The experiments found that
people struggle to incorporate concepts such as risk aggregation, estimate
variance, and sample distribution into their decisions. People only seemed to be
able to do this when the concept was expressed visually very explicitly.
However, when there were multiple cues for choice evaluation, the results also
showed that people were capable of integrating conflicting information in their
decisions. Identifying such cognitive bounds helped to both better understand
how people evaluate multiple choices and future research can use this work to
develop methods to facilitate better decisions.</p>
