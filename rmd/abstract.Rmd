Resource allocation decisions are critical for large organisations. The
management literature mainly considers such decisions from an organisational
perspective, despite the potential psychological influences. Therefore, I
investigated people's cognitive limitations in the resource allocation process.
I did this through three paradigms that provided participants both opportunities
to make use of clear cues to moderate their decisions and also important
statistical principles that would enhance their decisions even further. First,
participants saw sequential risky choices without feedback. Combining the risk
through *risk aggregation* allowed participants to reduce the overall potential
loss. Second, participants were asked to allocate capital across a set of
business projects with different attributes. The *estimate variance* associated
with uncertain forecasts allowed for a better moderation of the metric used to
make the choice. Third, participants saw either relevant or irrelevant anecdotal
evidence that conflicted with statistical evidence for a project. The *sample
distribution* of similarity to the target project from the sample of anecdotes
allowed participants to clarify this conflicting evidence. The results showed
that people struggled to use these statistical principles, unless in the case of
risk aggregation when it was depicted visually. Otherwise, participants did
appropriately use information about forecast metric reliability when this was
expressed verbally, rather than numerically. Similarly, despite ignoring sample
distribution information, participants moderated their use of anecdotes by the
similarity of the anecdote to the target project. Further, participants tended
to integrate conflicting information about the projects through a trade-off.
These results show that people's resource allocation decisions are bounded by an
understanding of certain statistical principles, but that they are capable of
more nuanced choice when given more salient information.
