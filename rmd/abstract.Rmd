Capital allocation decisions are critical for large organisations. Management
research mainly considers such decisions from an organisational perspective,
largely overlooking potential psychological influences. Therefore, this thesis
investigated cognitive processes that affect capital allocation decisions. Three
studies examined how participants integrated multiple kinds of cues when making
their decisions. Each study presented participants with both statistical
information and non-numerical semantic information. In each study, participants
had the opportunity to leverage a statistical principle that arguably should be
the sole basis of the decision. The first study showed participants sequential
risky choices without intermittent feedback. Participants could have combined
the risk across decisions to reduce the overall potential loss. However, they
struggled to do this, unless it was depicted visually. The second study asked
participants to allocate a budget across a set of business projects.
Participants could have used the variance associated with the provided forecast
estimates to choose which metrics to use for the allocation. However, they only
appropriately used this information when it was expressed verbally, and did not
when it was expressed numerically. In the third study, participants saw projects
with conflicting statistical and anecdotal evidence. The anecdotes were either
similar or dissimilar to the target project. Participants could have clarified
the conflicting evidence by using provided information about the distribution
from which the anecdote was sampled. However, they ignored this information.
Despite this, participants moderated their use of anecdotes by the similarity of
the anecdote to the target project. These results show that people's capital
allocation decisions are bounded by a limited understanding of certain
statistical principles, but that they are capable of more nuanced choice when
properly scaffolded.
