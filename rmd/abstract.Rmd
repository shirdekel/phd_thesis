Resource allocation decisions are critical for large organisations. The
management literature mainly considers such decisions from an organisational
perspective, largely overlooking potential psychological influences. Therefore,
I investigated cognitive processes affecting resource allocation decisions. I
did this through three studies that examined how participants integrated
multiple kinds of cues when making their decisions. In each study, I presented
both statistical information and other kinds of non-numerical cues (forms of
semantic and visual information). Each study analysed a different decision
context, and thus correspondingly there were different forms of statistical and
non-numerical information. However, every case presented the opportunity to
leverage a statistical principle (below named in italics) that arguably should
be the sole basis of the decision. Despite this, the nature of the semantic and
visual cues affected how deciders utilised the statistical principles. In the
first study, participants saw sequential risky choices without intermittent
feedback (Chapter \@ref(aggregation)). Combining the risk across decisions
through *risk aggregation* allowed participants to reduce the overall potential
loss. Second, participants were asked to allocate capital across a set of
business projects with different attributes (Chapter \@ref(alignment)). The
*estimate variance* associated with uncertain forecasts allowed for a better
moderation of the metric used to make the choice. Third, participants saw either
relevant or irrelevant anecdotal evidence that conflicted with statistical
evidence for a project (Chapter \@ref(anecdotes)). The *sample distribution* of
similarity to the target project from the sample of anecdotes allowed
participants to clarify this conflicting evidence. The results showed that
people struggled to use these statistical principles, unless in the case of risk
aggregation when it was depicted visually in the first study. In the second
study, participants did appropriately use information about forecast metric
reliability when this was expressed verbally, but not numerically. Similarly in
the third study, despite ignoring sample distribution information,
participants moderated their use of anecdotes by the similarity of the anecdote
to the target project. Further, participants tended to integrate conflicting
information about the projects through a trade-off. These results show that
people’s resource allocation decisions are bounded by a limited understanding of
certain statistical principles, but that they are capable of more nuanced choice
when properly scaffolded.
