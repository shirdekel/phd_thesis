Resource allocation decisions are critical for large organisations. The
management literature mainly considers such decisions from an organisational
perspective, largely overlooking potential psychological influences. Therefore,
I investigated cognitive processes affecting resource allocation decisions. I
did this through three paradigms that examined how participants integrated
multiple kinds of cues when making their decisions. In each study, there was
statistical information presented, and other kinds of non-numerical cues (forms
of semantic and visual information). Each paradigm analyzed a different decision
context, and thus correspondingly there was different statistical and other
forms of information. However every case presented the opportunity to leverage a
statistical principle (below named in italics) that arguably should be the sole
basis of the decision, and yet, the nature of the semantic and visual cues
affected how deciders utilized the statistical principles. In the first
paradigm, participants saw sequential risky choices without intermittent
feedback (Ch 2). Combining the risk across decisions through risk aggregation
allowed participants to reduce the overall potential loss. Second, participants
were asked to allocate capital across a set of business projects with different
attributes (Ch 4.). The estimate variance associated with uncertain forecasts
allowed for a better moderation of the metric used to make the choice. Third,
participants saw either relevant or irrelevant anecdotal evidence that
conflicted with statistical evidence for a project (Ch. 6). The sample
distribution of similarity to the target project from the sample of anecdotes
allowed participants to clarify this conflicting evidence. The results showed
that people struggled to use these statistical principles, unless in the case of
risk aggregation when it was depicted visually. In paradigm 2, participants did
appropriately use information about forecast metric reliability when this was
expressed verbally, but not numerically. Similarly, despite ignoring sample
distribution information, participants moderated their use of anecdotes by the
similarity of the anecdote to the target project. Further, participants tended
to integrate conflicting information about the projects through a trade-off.
These results show that peopleâ€™s resource allocation decisions are bounded by
limited understanding of certain statistical principles, but that they are
capable of more nuanced choice when properly scaffolded..
