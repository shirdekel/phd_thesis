<!-- Organisations have a big impact on the world -->

Much of modern life depends on large organisations. General Electric (GE) makes
the engines that go in our aircrafts, Johnson & Johnson make our shampoo, and
Google allows us to search the internet. The areas of our lives that are less
affected by such private firms, depend on public sector organisations such as
public hospitals, schools, and police. The justification for the existence of
organisations of this size is that the particular combination of individual
divisions, alongside a corporate management, will lead to better performance for
each of the divisions than they would have been able to generate individually.
In other words, the assumption is that such organisations create a synergy---the
quality of the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts.

<!-- They are made up of multiple divisions -->

Multi-divisional organisations are typically organised in a hierarchical
structure, with a corporate management team and subsidiary divisions. Each
division is usually made up of several business units. For instance, some of
GE's divisions include GE Aviation and GE Healthcare. Similarly, in the public
sector, a hospital system may operate through multiple individual hospitals in
certain regions.

<!-- This means resource allocation -->

Such organisations therefore need to make resource allocation decisions. That
is, given a limited amount of resources (e.g., financial, organisational), how
best to invest in the multiple divisions? Equally? Pick a winner? Resource
allocation is a critical process to the operation and development of
multi-divisional organisations.

<!-- Many decisions come from one or few people -->

The products and services that arise from organisations are (necessarily) a
result of the work of many people. In GE, for instance, the factories that
generate aircraft engines need to be staffed by production line workers,
accountant are needed for bookkeeping, and software engineers are needed to
design and maintain the production systems. Despite this, many important
strategic decisions ultimately come from a very small number of people. The
decisions that the CEO or other lower level executives make can have large
consequences on the life of the company.

<!-- Managers are biased -->

It is often assumed that a few people having a lot of decision-making power is
for the best. Managers of large organisations often appear to be bold and
effective decision-makers. It appears that their position of power and wealth
was necessarily arrived at through high competence and rational decision-making,
suggesting the organisation is in good hands. However, that much of an
organisation's future (and by extension often many more components of the
economy) depends on the decisions of a few individual may be concerning for
three reasons. First, it is unclear what the role of survivorship bias was in
obtaining the manager's role, because the number of managers that used the same
strategy and failed is unknown. Second, decades of work have shown that people's
decision-making is often fallible and that job experience does not always
alleviate this. Third, managers of large organisations often face uncertain
environments, which strengthens psychological biases.

<!-- Examples of the consequences of biased manager decision-making? -->

<!-- Not enough work on resource allocation biases -->

One class of biases has not been well studied: resource allocation biases. This
is a rather large hole in the literature because resource allocation decisions
are at the centre of executive and lower level managersâ€™ roles. When making
capital allocation decisions, there are elements of the decision making
environment that can be deceiving for managers. In this thesis I examine how the
framing of a series of business projects affects people's decisions about those
projects. Specifically, the same set of projects, presented in aggregate form,
is much more likely to be accepted. Further, sometimes people are distracted by
extraneous semantic information, such as the relative similarity of the options.

I find that although people in general make sensible decisions, they fail to
moderate them appropriately when presented with critical information.
Specifically, information about metric variance is ignored even when other
metrics are available. Further, people seem to appropriately use statistical and
anecdotal information based on relevance to the situation at hand, but ignore
information about the sampling of the anecdote. Below I discuss the important
financial consequences of not appropriately using these kinds of statistical
principles. In short, people overall tend to make sound decisions, but fail to
appropriately moderate them in situations that have more subtle (but
consequential) statistical implications.

Next, I will explain how the resource allocation process functions in
hierarchical organisations, and why it is necessary to analyse such a process
with a psychological approach. I will then review the literature on
decision-making biases and how these may apply to resource allocation decisions.
Finally, I will summarise the rest of the thesis chapters.
