## Chapter overview

In sum the potential consequences for a diversified hierarchical structure are
that projects will be consisdered one at a time, and if they are considered
togetherj, disparate project types will make comparisons hard. Considering
projects one by one might mean that risk is not aggregated across projects and
therefore value is lost. The difficultly to compare will lead to both
potentially relying on unreliable metrics, and relying on improper anecdotal
evidence. The thesis is that people often go half-way. They do not completely
disregard the normative strategy, but also struggle to moderate their decisions
when it comes to more subtle statistical principles such as aggregation,
variance, and sampling.

In the previous section I identified three resource allocation processes that
are currently under-studied and so are important to investigate further. First,
the evaluation of individual project proposals might lead to managers only
considering such projects one at a time, despite the opportunity of aggregating
a portfolio of such projects. The choice bracketing literature suggests that
there are ways of facilitating such aggregation, but does not investigate this
without providing participants inter-trial feedback. Second, in situations in
which managers compare multiple projects, the structural alignment literature
suggests that managers in diversified firms will struggle to allocate more than
those in more integrated firms. Further, these managers might not be sensitive
to the variance inherent in the financial metrics they rely on. Third, a
difficulty to compare across existing projects might instead mean a reliance on
prior case studies from personal or external experience. Research on anecdotal
bias suggests that managers might rely more on such case studies than on
aggregated data, but it is unclear whether they will use relevance to moderate
their decisions.

Therefore, I investigate the psychology of resource allocation decisions in
three chapters. In Chapter \@ref(aggregation) I investigate the effects of
choice bracketing on risk aggregation without feedback. In
Chapter \@ref(interstitial-1), I discuss the difference between evaluating
project proposals with inherent budget estimates and the process of allocating
an existing budget top-down. In Chapter \@ref(alignment) I investigate the
effects of alignment and reliability type---verbal or numerical---on
allocations. In Chapter \@ref(interstitial-2), I discuss the
trade-offs that people make when using information to evaluate options such as
project proposals. Finally, in Chapter \@ref(anecdotes) I investigate the effects
of anecdote similarity on the anecdotal bias.
