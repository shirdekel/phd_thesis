# Chapter \@ref(aggregation) appendix {#aggregation-appendix}

\minitoc

This appendix contains supplementary materials and analyses for the two
experiments reported in Chapter \@ref(aggregation). In addition, I also report
two experiments that were conducted to follow-up the findings in Experiments 1
and 2. Both follow-up experiments tested project choice as in the first two
experiments, but Experiment 3 further investigated the effect of similarity, and
Experiment 4 further investigated the effect of awareness.

All four experiments featured probability outcome distributions. These were
Poisson binomial distributions that were calculated using the R package
`poibin`, which uses calculations described in @hong2013.
