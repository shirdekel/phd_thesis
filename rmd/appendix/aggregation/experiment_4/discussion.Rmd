### Discussion

I did not find evidence for my hypothesis. There was no significant effect of
awareness on project choice by trial. I expected to see participants in the
aware condition to become less risk averse as they continued with the experiment
if they were using a strategy similar to the law of small numbers. The fact that
this effect was not replicated in Experiment 4 might mean that the finding in
Experiment 1 was due to the specific gambles used in that experiment, or
statistical chance.
