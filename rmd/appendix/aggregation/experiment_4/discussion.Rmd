### Discussion

Experiment 4 did not find evidence for
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:awareness-trials-aggregation-2). There was no significant
effect of awareness on project choice by trial. Participants in the aware
condition were expected to become less risk averse as they continued with the
experiment if they were using a strategy similar to the law of small numbers.
The fact that this effect was not replicated in Experiment 4 might mean that the
finding in Experiment 1 was due to the specific gambles used in that experiment,
or statistical chance.
