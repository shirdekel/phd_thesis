Experiment 4 investigated the effect of "awareness" on project choice. In
Experiment 1 we found an effect of awareness in the trial-by-trial data that was
not replicated in Experiment 2. Previously, I explained this effect using the
law of small numbers; people may have been anticipating less risky gambles
towards the end of the set. As such, it might be the case that the effect will
be seen with more trials. In Experiment 4 we attempted to replicate the effect
from Experiment 1 with 20 projects. The "naive" condition attempted to encourage
participants to focus on projects one at a time and did not say how many
projects there were. The "aware" condition attempted to encourage participants
to think of all 20 projects (by saying the total number in the beginning, and
notifying participants where they were in the project order). I again tested HypothesisÂ \@ref(hyp:awareness-trials-aggregation-2).
