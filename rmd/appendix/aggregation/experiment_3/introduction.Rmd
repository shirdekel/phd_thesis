Experiment 3 investigated the effect of similarity on project choice. The
previous experiments did not counterbalance the project domain when displaying
the 10 projects to participants. Experiment 3 used 10 different potential
business domains when constructing the project descriptions in order to reduce
any potential effect that the specific domain may have on people's choice.
Therefore, Experiment 3 again tested
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:similarity-aggregation-1).
