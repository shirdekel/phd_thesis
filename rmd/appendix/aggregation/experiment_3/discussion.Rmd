### Discussion

I found some evidence for the effect of similarity on project choice, but it was
in the opposite direction to the one hypothesised. Specifically, I found that
when considering projects individually, participants' risk aversion did not
differ between similarity conditions, but when offered a portfolio of the
projects, those that saw the dissimilar projects were more likely to invest.

These results provide evidence for the naive diversification account expressed
[above](#similarity-discussion-aggregation-1). Specifically, it may be the case
that participants really are naively diversifying, but only when they are
explicitly given an opportunity to do so. This is similar to the multi-play
effects in that the question itself provides a sort of choice bracketing. That
is, the gambles are grouped together as a package/portfolio by the question.
Together, this suggests that people are not naively aggregating when viewing
gambles in isolation, but when the choices are bracketed explicitly, then the
choice seems to be driven by a naive diversification.
