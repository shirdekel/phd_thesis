## Experiment 3 {#alignment-8-appendix}

I simulated the effects I hypothesised in Experiment 3 in See
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-simulation-alignment-8). These effects were taken as a
composite of Experiment 1 data (without the no NPV condition) for the verbal
reliability type condition, and data from a pilot study (see
Appendix \@ref(alignment-7)) for the numerical reliability type condition.
