## Experiment 3 {#alignment-8-appendix}

Figure \@ref(fig:plot-simulation-alignment-8) shows the simulated hypothesised
effects for Experiment 3. These effects were constructed as a composite of
Experiment 1 data (without the no NPV condition) for the verbal reliability type
condition, and data from a pilot study (see Appendix \@ref(alignment-7)) for the
numerical reliability type condition. Variance was removed to see the effects
clearer.

(ref:plot-simulation-alignment-8) Experiment 3 predicted data.
