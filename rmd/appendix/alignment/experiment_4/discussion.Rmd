### Discussion

Experiment 4 found evidence for most of the hypotheses. As per
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2), laypeople responded
appropriately to verbal reliability instructions in the high alignment
condition. Contrary to
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2), however,
participants also did this in the low reliability condition. That is, regardless
of the type of project display, participants tended to use NPV more when they
were told that it was reliable and tended to use it less when they were told
that it was unreliable. Further, there was no evidence that this effect was
moderated by alignment condition, contrary to
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2). However,
the linear NPV trend was higher in the high than low alignment condition,
when averaging over reliability amount, as predicted in
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2). This suggests that
overall participants still make more use of NPV information when it is hard to
compare between projects.

Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1) was not supported, as
there was no evidence of a main effect of alignment on participants' confidence
in their allocation decisions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the
difference in confidence between reliability conditions was greater in the low
alignment condition. This may reflect participants' difficulty in making sense
of their choices when alignment was low, given more confidence when assured of
the reliability of NPV. In the high alignment condition, on the other hand,
regardless of reliability condition, they had a way of using the reliability
information. Further, confidence also seemed to increase more with NPV, on
average, more when projects were dissimilar, which provides evidence for their
reliance on NPV in this situation.
