## Experiment 4 {#alignment-1}

```{r setup-alignment-1}
tar_load(descriptives_alignment_1)
tar_load(materials_alignment_1)
tar_load(results_alignment_1)
tar_load(plot_alignment_1)
```

Experiment 4 further investigated the effects of alignment and verbal NPV
reliability information on financial resource allocation decisions. I replicated
the same methodology as in [Experiment 1](#method-alignment-2), except for two
main changes. First, I manipulated the alignment conditions within subjects.
Second, I removed the no NPV condition to the NPV reliability variable.

I expected to replicate the results of [Experiment 1](#results-alignment-2).
Specifically, I expect that in the high alignment condition, participants will
be able to respond to each reliability condition, whereas, in the low alignment
condition, they will rely more on NPV regardless of reliability condition.


In addition to the all-project allocation data analysed above, here I report
analyses for the just for the "target project". This is allocation of resources
to the project that had the highest NPV, but the lowest value on concrete
measures intrinsic to the actual product, e.g., the capacity of a laptop in
gigabytes. Therefore, a higher allocation value indicated a higher reliance on
NPV. Further, I report the method and analyses for the confidence measure.

``` {hypothesis, confidence-alignment-alignment-1, echo = TRUE}
Participants will be more confident about their decisions in the high alignment
condition than in the low alignment condition.
```
