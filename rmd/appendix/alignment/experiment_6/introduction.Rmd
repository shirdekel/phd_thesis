## Experiment 6

```{r setup-alignment-5}
tar_load(descriptives_alignment_5)
tar_load(results_alignment_5)
tar_load(plot_alignment_5)
```

Experiment 6 further investigated the effects of alignment and NPV Presence
information on forecasting. Experiment 5 did not clearly replicate the
forecasting results of Experiment 1, potentially due to low power, so this
experiment collected a much larger sample size. As before, it was hypothesised
that people’s forecasting would be less variable when comparing projects with
alignable differences, than when comparing projects with non-alignable
differences.
