## Experiment 6

```{r setup-alignment-5}
tar_load(descriptives_alignment_5)
tar_load(results_alignment_5)
tar_load(plot_alignment_5)
```

Experiment 6 further investigated the effects of alignment and NPV Presence
information on forecasting. We did not clearly replicate the forecasting results
of Experiment 3, potentially due to low power, so in this experiment we
collected a much larger sample size. As before, we hypothesised that peopleâ€™s
forecasting would be less variable when comparing projects with alignable
differences, than when comparing projects with non-alignable differences.
