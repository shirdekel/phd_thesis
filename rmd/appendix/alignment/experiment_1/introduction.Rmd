## Experiment 1 {#alignment-2-appendix}

In addition to the allocation measure, I also asked participants to rank the projects and forecast their future returns.
I included the ranking task before the allocation task in order to encourage alignment and to have another measure of participants' decision-making. I added the forecasting task (described further [below](#forecasting-materials-alignment-2)) in order to test whether the variance in people's forecasts is affected by alignment and NPV reliability.

``` {hypothesis, ranking-all-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
All allocation effects will replicate in the ranking measure.
```

``` {hypothesis, forecasting-mean-all-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
All allocation effects will replicate in the forecasting mean measure.
```

In the forecasting measures, I expect that more alignable differences therefore bring about more certainty about forecasting decisions, since participants will have more easily comparable information. As such, peopleâ€™s forecasting should be less variable when comparing projects with alignable differences, than when comparing projects with non-alignable differences. 

``` {hypothesis, forecasting-sd-alignment-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
The standard deviation of participants' forecasts will be higher, on average,
in the low alignment condition than in the high alignment condition.
```
