### Discussion

Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:confidence-alignment-alignment-1) was not supported, as
there was no evidence of a main effect of alignment on participants' confidence
in their allocation decisions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the
difference in confidence between reliability conditions is greater in the low
alignment condition. This may reflect participants' difficulty in making sense
of their choices when alignment was low, given more confidence when assured of
the reliability of NPV. In the high alignment condition, on the other hand,
regardless of reliability condition, they had a way of using the reliability
information. Further, confidence also seemed to increase more with NPV, on
average, more when projects were dissimilar, which provides evidence for their
reliance on NPV in this situation. There was limited evidence for the effect of
alignment on forecast variability. Experiments 5 and 6 attempted to replicate
this result with more participants.
