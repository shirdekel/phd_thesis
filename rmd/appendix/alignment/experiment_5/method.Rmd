### Method

#### Participants

`r descriptives_alignment_4$apa` Table \@ref(tab:condition-allocation-alignment-4)
shows the between-subjects condition allocation.

```{r condition-allocation-alignment-4}
descriptives_alignment_4$condition_allocation_table %>%
  apa_table("Experiment 5 group allocation.")
```

#### Materials

##### Instructions

##### Risky investment task

We only used the forecasting task used in Experiment 1, except that it was fixed
by adding the relevant percentage intervals that were left out in Experiment 1,
seen in Figure \@ref(fig:forecasting-alignment-4).

(ref:forecasting-alignment-4) An example of the forecasting task in Experiment 5.

```{r forecasting-alignment-4, fig.cap = "(ref:forecasting-alignment-4)"}
here(
  materials_alignment_4,
  "forecasting.png"
) %>%
  image_read() %>%
  image_trim()
```

#### Procedure

The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1, except participants only
completed the forecasting task.
