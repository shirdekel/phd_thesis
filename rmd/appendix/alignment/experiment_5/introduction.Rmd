Experiment 5 further investigated the effects of alignment and explicit NPV
Presence information on forecasting. The goal of this experiment was to
replicate the forecasting results of Experiment 1, but with a sample that has
investing experience. As before, the hypothesis was that people’s forecasting
would be less variable when comparing projects with alignable differences, than
when comparing projects with non-alignable differences.
