Experiment 5 further investigated the effects of alignment and explicit NPV
Presence information on forecasting. We set out to replicate the forecasting
results of Experiment 3, but with a sample that has investing experience. As
before, we hypothesised that peopleâ€™s forecasting would be less variable when
comparing projects with alignable differences, than when comparing projects with
non-alignable differences.
