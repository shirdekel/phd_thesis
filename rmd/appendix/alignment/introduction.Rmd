# Chapter \@ref(alignment) appendix {#alignment-appendix}

\minitoc

This appendix contains supplementary materials and analyses for the three
experiments reported in Chapter \@ref(alignment). In addition, I report five
related experiments. Experiment 4 was identical to Experiment 1, except that
alignment was manipulated within-subjects, it did not include a no NPV
condition, and there was no forecasting measure. Experiment 5 replicated
Experiment 1, but only tested the forecasting effect and did so with a sample
with investing experience. Experiment 6 replicated Experiment 5 but with a
larger sample size and a lay sample. Experiment 7 attempted to facilitate a use
of numerical reliability through explicit hints. Experiment 8 tested both verbal
and numerical reliability effects in an all within-subjects design. However,
unlike Experiment 3, the design of Experiment 8 did not allow for a direct
comparison of alignment conditions.
