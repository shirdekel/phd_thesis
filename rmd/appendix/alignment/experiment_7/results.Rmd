### Results

#### Allocation

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of hint
and NPV variance on participants’ allocations. As seen in
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-alignment-6-allocation), none of the interactions or main
effects were significant.

(ref:plot-alignment-6-allocation) Mean allocation.

```{r plot-alignment-6-allocation, fig.cap = "(ref:plot-alignment-6-allocation)"}

```

#### Ranking

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of hint and NPV
variance on participants’ project rankings. As seen in
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-alignment-6-ranking), only the main effect of NPV amount
was significant, `r results_alignment_6$ranking$npv_amount`.

(ref:plot-alignment-6-ranking) Mean ranking.

```{r plot-alignment-6-ranking, fig.cap = "(ref:plot-alignment-6-ranking)"}
plot_alignment_6$ranking
