### Discussion

Experiment 7 found that explicitly telling participants how to use variance
information to moderate their allocations did not help them do so. However,
there was an increased reliance on NPV with more hints in the ranking data. This
suggests that the hint manipulations potentially simply increase participants'
attention to NPV.
