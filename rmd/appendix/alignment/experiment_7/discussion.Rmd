### Discussion

ExperimentÂ 7 found that explicitly telling participants how to use variance
information to moderate their allocations did not help them do so. However,
there was an increased reliance on NPV with more hints in the ranking data. This
suggests that the hint manipulations potentially simply increase participants'
attention to NPV. It is possible that the study was under-powered, as there was
substantial variance in both the allocation and ranking data. Future work should
attempt to replicate this experiment with a larger sample.
