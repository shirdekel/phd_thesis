Experiment 7 investigated potential ways to facilitate people's use of variance
in capital allocation. Arguably, people's decisions should depend on variance,
especially with a small set of projects. That is, when considering between two
potential measures to use for capital allocation, measures with narrow ranges
should be relied upon more than those with wider ranges. As such, this
experiment presented participants with the same capital allocation scenario as
in Experiment 2, but only in low numerical reliability displays. Experiment 7
varied both the variance associated with NPV, and the extent to which
participants were explicitly hinted to use the variance information. It was
predicted that participants' allocations would be more likely to be informed by
variance when told explicitly to do so with increased salience for variance,
than when only salience is increase, or when no hint is given.
