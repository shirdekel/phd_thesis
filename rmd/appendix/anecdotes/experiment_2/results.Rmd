#### Allocation

##### Similarity manipulation check

The similarity manipulation worked as expected, with the negative valence
anecdote only low similarity condition being allocated significantly more than
those in the high similarity condition,
`r results_anecdotes_2$anecdotes_only_similarity$valence_negative`. In the
positive valence condition, those in the high similarity condition allocation
significantly more than those in the low similarity condition,
`r results_anecdotes_2$anecdotes_only_similarity$valence_positive`

#### Ratings

##### Similarity manipulation check

Our similarity manipulation seems to have worked, with participants rating
anecdotes in the high similarity conditions as more similar to the target than
those in the low similarity condition,
`r results_anecdotes_2$similarity_rating_similarity`.

(ref:plot-anecdotes-2-similarity-rating) Mean similarity rating of Project A (the target project) to the anecdote. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

##### Allocation is influenced by perceived similarity

As hypothesised, allocation was influenced by perceived similarity. That is, in
the negative valence condition, there was a negative correlation between
allocation and similarity rating,
`r results_anecdotes_2$allocation_similarity_rating$negative_high_low`.
However, in the positive valence condition,
there was a positive correlation between allocation and similarity rating,
`r results_anecdotes_2$allocation_similarity_rating$positive_high_low`.

##### The relationship between allocation and specific-relevance is moderated by similarity

In the negative valence condition, there was a significant difference between
the slopes of the high and low similarity conditions,
`r results_anecdotes_2$allocation_specific_relevance$high_low_negative`.
In the low similarity condition, allocation and specific-relevance rating were
not correlated,
`r results_anecdotes_2$allocation_specific_relevance$negative_loweffect`,
whereas, in the low similarity condition, they were correlated negatively
`r results_anecdotes_2$allocation_specific_relevance$negative_higheffect`.

In the positive valence condition, there was a significant difference between
the slopes of the high and low similarity conditions,
`r results_anecdotes_2$allocation_specific_relevance$high_low_positive`.
In the low similarity condition, allocation and specific-relevance rating were
not correlated,
`r results_anecdotes_2$allocation_specific_relevance$positive_loweffect`,
whereas, in the low similarity condition, they were correlated positively
`r results_anecdotes_2$allocation_specific_relevance$positive_higheffect`.

##### People do not consider general-relevance in their allocation

There were no significant correlations between allocation and general-relevance
rating.
