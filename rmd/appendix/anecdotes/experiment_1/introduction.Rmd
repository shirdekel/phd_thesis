## Experiment 1 {#anecdotes-1-appendix}

``` {hypothesis, similarity-check-anecdotes-1, name = "Similarity manipulation check for negative anecdote", echo = TRUE}
In the negative valence condition, allocations for the anecdote only low
similarity condition will be higher than those in the anecdote only high
similarity condition.
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-similarity-anecdotes-1, name = "Relationship between allocation and perceived similarity for positive anecdote", echo = TRUE}
In the negative valence condition, the correlation between allocation and
similarity rating will be negative
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-specific-relevance-anecdotes-1, name = "Relationship between allocation and specific-relevance for positive anecdote", echo = TRUE}
In the negative valence condition, there will be no correlation between
allocation and specific-relevance rating in the low similarity condition, but a
negative correlation in the high similarity condition.
```

After the allocation task, I asked participants to rate the relevance of the
anecdote to the target project. I predicted that those that saw only an
anecdote would be more influenced by the similarity of the anecdote than those
that saw an anecdote as well as statistics. Therefore, the following hypotheses
are tested:

``` {hypothesis, relevance-specific-anecdotes-1, echo = TRUE}
The similarity effect on specific relevance will be greater in the anecdote only
condition than in the anecdote + statistics condition.
```

``` {hypothesis, relevance-specific-enhanced-anecdotes-1, echo = TRUE}
The similarity effect on specific relevance will be greater in the statistics +
anecdote condition than in the anecdote + enhanced statistics condition.
```

Further, I asked participants to rate the relevance of the anecdote to other
projects in the same industry. I predicted that those that saw only an anecdote
would be more influenced by the similarity of the anecdote than those that saw
an anecdote as well as statistics. Therefore, the following hypotheses are
tested:

``` {hypothesis, relevance-general-anecdotes-1, echo = TRUE}
The similarity effect on general relevance will be greater in the anecdote only
condition than in the anecdote + statistics condition.
```

``` {hypothesis, relevance-general-enhanced-anecdotes-1, echo = TRUE}
The similarity effect on general relevance will be greater in the statistics +
anecdote condition than in the anecdote + enhanced statistics condition.
```
