### Results {#results-alignment-2}

A within-subjects factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of
NPV amount, alignment, and numerical NPV reliability on participants’ project
allocations. Figure \@ref(fig:plot-alignment-3-allocation) shows these data. The
alignment $\times$ reliability amount $\times$ NPV amount interaction was
significant,
`r results_alignment_3$allocation$alignment_reliability_amount_npv_amount`.
However, this appeared to be driven by the difference between alignment
conditions in the interaction between the quadratic NPV amount trend and
reliability amount,
`r results_alignment_3$allocation$quadratic_low_high_low_high`, even after
applying a Šidák correction. The same interaction but with the linear NPV trend
was not significant,
`r results_alignment_3$allocation$linear_low_high_low_high`. Further, the linear
NPV trend did not differ between reliability amount condition in neither the low
alignment condition, `r results_alignment_3$allocation$linear_low_high_low`, nor
the high alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_3$allocation$linear_low_high_high`. However, averaging over
reliability amount, the linear NPV trend was higher in the low alignment
condition than in the high alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_3$allocation$linear_low_high`. This suggests that
participants relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar than when they
were similar.

The ranking data were congruent with these results, while the confidence data
were less so. Further, the NPV knowledge data did not replicate the effect from
@long2018 [Study 1]. These analyses are reported in
Appendix \@ref(results-alignment-3-appendix).
