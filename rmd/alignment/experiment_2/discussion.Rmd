### Discussion

Experiment 2 replicated the alignment effect found in Experiment 1 with
participants with real-world business experience. That is,
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2) was supported, as people
relied more on NPV when faced with a set of dissimilar project than when
projects were all from the same domain. Experiment 2 also found evidence for
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3), with no
significant differences between the numerical reliability amount conditions.
While Experiment 2 did not replicate the interaction found in Experiment 1, it
should be emphasised that these are two different effects. In Experiment 1,
participants were explicitly told about the reliability of the NPV measure,
whereas in Experiment 2, they were provided with variance information that
merely implies NPV reliability. Thus, Experiment 2 showed that business students
are affected by comparability of project sets, but not by numerical NPV
reliability information. Specifically, participants appeared to only focus on
the NPV itself, and not on any variations in the underlying noisiness of the
measure for a specific project.
  
However, it is unclear whether laypeople would also display this variance
neglect. Further, in Experiments 1 and 2, the business projects consisted of a
limited number of domains. It is unclear to what extent these specific domains
influenced the results. These projects were centred around consumer products,
which were originally chosen to be more easily accessible to participants
without business experience. However, with these projects, individual features
do not necessarily indicate a project's profitability. For instance, a laptop
with a low capacity can be more profitable than a laptop with a high capacity
due to the existence of consumer goods markets. Experiment 3 addressed these
limitations.

Another limitation of the last two experiments was the potential presentation
style confound. The two alignment conditions differed in the number of alignable
differences, but also in the way that the information was presented. The
information in the low alignment condition was presented in paragraphs, whereas
the information in the high alignment condition was presented in tables. While
it is likely that each of these data types would be presented in this way in a
business setting, it is important to rule out that this manipulation did not
also unnecessarily increase task difficulty. Therefore, Experiment 3 attempted
to replicate this effect, while controlling for presentation style.
