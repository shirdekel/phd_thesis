### Discussion

Experiment 2 replicated the alignment effect found in Experiment 1 with
participants with real-world business experience. I found evidence for
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2), as people seemed to rely
more on NPV when faced with a set of dissimilar project than when projects were
all from the same domain. Further, I found evidence for
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3), with no
significant differences between the numerical reliability amount conditions.
While I did not replicate the interaction found in Experiment 1, it should be
emphasised that these are two different effects. In Experiment 1, I explicitly
told participants about the reliability of the NPV measure, whereas in
Experiment 2, I provided them with variance information that merely implies NPV
reliability. Thus, I showed that business students are affected by comparability
of project sets, but not by numerical NPV reliability information. Specifically,
participants appeared to only focus on the NPV itself, and not on any variations
in the underlying noisiness of the measure for a specific project.
  
However, it is unclear whether laypeople would also display this variance
neglect. Further, in Experiments 1 and 2, the business projects consisted of
a limited number of domains. It is unclear to what extent these specific domains
influenced the results. These projects were centred around consumer products,
with various features displayed. Consumer projects were chosen to be more easily
accessible to participants without business experience. However, with these
projects, individual features do not necessarily indicate a project's
profitability. For instance, a laptop with a low capacity can be more profitable
than a laptop with a high capacity due to the existence of consumer goods
markets. In Experiment 3, I addressed these limitations.

Another limitation of the last two experiments was the potential presentation
style confound. The two alignment conditions differed in the number of alignable
differences, but also in the way that the information was presented. The
information in the low alignment condition was presented in paragraphs, whereas
the information in the high alignment condition was presented in tables. While
it is likely that each of these data types would be presented in this way in a
business setting, it is important to rule out that this manipulation did not
also unnecessarily increase task difficulty. Therefore, Experiment 3 attempted
to replicate this effect, while controlling for presentation style.
