### Discussion

Based on participants with real-world business experience, Experiment 2
replicated the alignment effect found in Experiment 1. That is, participants
relied more on NPV when faced with a set of dissimilar projects than when faced
with similar projects, supporting
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2). Experiment 2 also found
evidence for Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3), with
no significant differences between the numerical reliability conditions. While
Experiment 2 did not replicate the interaction found in Experiment 1, it should
be emphasised that these are two different effects. In Experiment 1,
participants were explicitly told whether the NPV measure was reliable, while in
Experiment 2, they were provided with variance information that merely implied
NPV reliability. Thus, the results of Experiment 2 show that business students
were affected by the comparability of projects but not by numerical NPV
reliability information. Specifically, participants appeared to focus only on
the NPV itself for a specific project, not on the underlying noisiness of the
measure.
  
The participants in Experiment 2 seemed to rely on NPV more than those in
Experiment 1. This was seen by the steeper linear trends in Experiment 2. This
discrepancy may be due to the difference in domain experience and exposure to
financial metrics in formal study. However, the extra explanation and testing of
NPV for the management students may have also increased its salience. In sum,
the Experiment 2 sample showed clearer trends of NPV reliance, but importantly
was still affected by similarity even when it was manipulated within-subjects.

Experiment 1 tested NPV reliability expressed verbally, while Experiment 2
tested NPV reliability expressed numerically. However, the difference in
findings was confounded by the different populations that were sampled. Further,
in both experiments, the business projects consisted of a limited number of
domains. It is unclear to what extent these specific domains influenced the
results. These projects were centred around consumer products, which were chosen
to be more easily accessible to participants without business experience.
However, the individual features of a project do not necessarily indicate its
profitability. For instance, a laptop with a low storage capacity may be more
profitable than one with a high storage capacity because of consumer goods
markets. Experiment 3 addressed these limitations.

Another limitation of Experiments 1 and 2 was the potential confounding effect
of presentation style. The two alignment conditions differed in the number of
alignable differences, but also in the way that the information was presented.
The information in the low alignment condition was presented as paragraphs,
while the information in the high alignment condition was presented as a table.
While it is likely that these data types would be presented in this way in the
business setting, it is important to rule out that this difference did not
unnecessarily increase task difficulty. Therefore, Experiment 3 attempted to
replicate this effect while controlling for presentation style
