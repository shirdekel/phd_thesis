Experiment 2 further investigated the effects of alignment and
numerically-expressed variance information on financial resource allocation
decisions. In [Experiment 1](#alignment-2) the information about the variance
inherent in the NPVs was communicated explicitly as the conclusion, e.g., NPV is
unreliable. In Experiment 2 however, only the actual variance information itself
was communicated without the conclusion about its reliability. Here, I simply
communicated variance by showing the range of predicted values (akin to a
confidence interval). Therefore, while previously I manipulated *verbal*
reliability, in Experiment 2 I manipulated *numerical* reliability. Further, in
this experiment, I studied participants with more business experience than the
previously used laypeople samples. The main two interests in this experiment
were first, whether the previous findings of an alignment effect will replicate
with people with more business experience; and second, whether this population
is sensitive to variance in forecasts. As well as again testing
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2), I tested the following
hypothesis:

``` {hypothesis, allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3, echo = TRUE}
The NPV amount $\times$ reliability amount interaction will not be significant
in either alignment condition.
```

I was also interested in the potential to quickly change participants'
understanding, if they did not initially use numerical reliability for their
allocations. Therefore, I presented participants with a short lecture on the
importance of paying attention variance in financial decision-making. However,
results were inconclusive, so see but see
Appendix \@ref(alignment-3-appendix), for a more detailed discussion.
