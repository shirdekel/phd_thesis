Experiment 2 investigated the effects of project alignment and
numerically-expressed NPV reliability information on capital allocation
decisions. In Experiment 1, the information about NPV reliability was
communicated explicitly (e.g., "NPV is unreliable"). However, in Experiment 2,
only the actual NPV information itself was communicated without the conclusion
about its reliability. Specifically, participants were given a range of
predicted values (akin to a confidence interval). Therefore, while Experiment 1
manipulated *verbal* NPV reliability, Experiment 2 manipulated *numerical* NPV
reliability. Further, Experiment 2 included participants with more business
experience. This experiment tested whether the previous findings of an alignment
effect would be replicated using participants with more business experience. The
experiment also tested whether this population is sensitive to variance in
forecasts.

Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2) was again tested to
investigate the alignment effect in the new sample. However, the other
hypotheses tested in Experiment 1 were not retested because Experiment 2
manipulated numerical reliability and did not include a no NPV condition.
Research has shown that people are poor at reasoning with numerical variance
information [@galesic2010; @konold1993; @vivalt2021; @batteux2020]. Therefore,
Experiment 2 tested the following hypothesis:

```{hypothesis, allocation-npv-reliability-alignment-3, name = "no effect of numerical reliability", echo = TRUE}
The NPV $\times$ reliability amount interaction will not be significant
in either alignment condition.
```

Experiment 2 also investigated the ability to quickly change participants'
understanding, if they did not initially use numerical NPV reliability in their
allocations. Therefore, participants were presented with a short lecture on the
importance of paying attention to variance in financial decision-making.
However, the results were inconclusive (see Appendix \@ref(alignment-3-appendix)
for a more detailed discussion). Further, Experiment 2 investigated whether
participants would be over-confident in their understanding of NPV [as in
@long2018]. These results are also reported in
Appendix \@ref(alignment-3-appendix) because they are not highly relevant to
this chapter.
