Experiment 3 investigated the effects of project alignment, NPV, NPV reliability
type and NPV reliability level on participants' budget allocations. Experiment 1
manipulated NPV reliability level using verbal prompts. That is, participants
were explicitly told whether or not NPV was reliable for a certain project.
Experiment 2 investigated whether people were able to extract the same
reliability information using numerical prompts. That is, participants were
provided with NPVs with either wide or narrow ranges, indicating either low or
high reliability, respectively. Moreover, given that laypeople were sampled for
Experiment 1, and Master of Management students were sampled for Experiment 2,
it was not possible to compare the two reliability types (verbal and numerical)
without ruling out the potential confounding effect of population type. Thus,
similar to Experiments 1 and 2, Experiment 3 manipulated project alignment, NPV
and NPV reliability level but also added reliability type. Further, presentation
style was a possible confounding factor in the previous experiments. That is,
projects in the high alignment condition were always displayed in a table, while
projects in the low alignment condition were always displayed as paragraphs.
This possible confounder was excluded in Experiment 3 by using the same
presentation style for both alignment conditions.

In Experiment 3, the expected results for the verbal reliability condition
replicated those of Experiment 1. The numerical reliability condition may
replicate the findings of Experiment 2. However, a pilot experiment (detailed in
Appendix \@ref(alignment-7)) found no significant differences between numerical
reliability conditions. Appendix \@ref(alignment-8-appendix) shows a simulation
of the hypothesised effects, with the numerical reliability effects based on the
findings of the pilot experiment. Therefore, Experiment 3 retested
Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:three-way-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2),
and \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2) for the verbal reliability
condition, but was agnostic between whether the numerical reliability condition
will look more like the pattern found in the pilot experiment or the pattern
found in Experiment 2.
