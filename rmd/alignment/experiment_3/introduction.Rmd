Experiment 3 investigated the effects of alignment, reliability type, NPV
amount, and reliability amount on allocations. Experiment 1 manipulated
reliability amount by using *verbal* prompts. That is, participants were told
explicitly whether or not NPV was reliable for a certain project industry.
Experiment 2 investigated whether people were able to extract this same kind of
reliability information from *numerical* prompts. That is, participants saw NPVs
with either wide or narrow ranges, indicating either low or high reliability of
the metric, respectively. However, Experiment 1 sampled laypeople, whereas
Experiment 2 sampled a Masters of Management course. Therefore, I was not able
to compare the two reliability types (verbal and numerical) without ruling out
the potential confound of population type. As such, in Experiment 3 I
manipulated NPV amount, alignment, and reliability amount, but also added a
reliability type factor. Further, presentation style was a possible confound in
the alignment manipulation of the previous experiments. That is, the business
projects in the high alignment condition were always displayed as a part of a
table, whereas the projects in the low alignment condition were displayed in
prose, as paragraphs. Experiment 3 fixed this by using the same presentation
style across alignment condition.

As well as again testing
Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2),
and \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2), I tested the following
hypothesis (see Figure \@ref(fig:plot-simulation-alignment-8) for a plot of a
simulation of all hypothesised effects):

``` {hypothesis, four-way-alignment-8, echo = TRUE}
The alignment $\times$ reliability amount $\times$ reliability type $\times$ NPV
amount interaction will be significant, such that the effects hypthesised above
will be seen in the verbal reliability condition, but none of these effects
will be seen in the numerical reliability condition.
