### Results

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV amount,
alignment, NPV reliability amount, and NPV reliability type on participants’
project allocations. Figure \@ref(fig:plot-alignment-8-allocation) shows these
data. Only the main results are reported here, while the rest of the
hypothesised allocation effects are reported in
Appendix \@ref(results-alignment-8-allocation). The predicted four-way
interaction (alignment $\times$ reliability amount $\times$ NPV amount $\times$
reliability type) was not significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$four_way`. However, most of the
hypothesised specific effects were found.

#### Verbal reliability

The three-way interaction (alignment $\times$ reliability amount $\times$ NPV
amount) in the verbal reliability condition was not significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_explicit_three_way`. This is
most likely due to the size of the two-way interactions in each alignment
condition being relatively similar, despite the expectation of no interaction in
the low alignment condition (as was seen in Experiment 1). In high alignment,
the interaction between the linear NPV amount trend and NPV reliability amount
was significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount`.
Specifically, the trend was stronger in the high reliability amount condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount_high_npv_amount`,
than in the low reliability amount condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount_low_npv_amount`.
This shows that, as in Experiment 1, participants moderate their allocations
based on verbally-expressed NPV reliability.

Contrary to Experiment 1, the interaction between the linear NPV amount trend
and NPV reliability amount was also significant in the low alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_low_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount`.
This suggests that participants were also able to moderate their allocations
based on verbal reliability in the low alignment condition. Despite the lack of
a three-way interaction in the verbal reliability condition (that would have
indicated a difference in the two alignment two-way interactions), the linear
NPV amount trend was stronger in the low alignment condition than in the high
alignment condition when averaging over reliability amount,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_explicit_alignment`. This
suggests that when NPV reliability was expressed verbally, as in Experiment 1,
participants relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar than when they
were similar.

#### Numerical reliability

In the numerical reliability condition, the linear NPV amount trend was not
significantly "equivalent" between those in the low and high alignment
conditions (averaging over reliability amount),
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_implicit_alignment_null`. In
fact, a post-hoc comparison suggests that the low alignment trend was stronger
(with Bonferroni adjustment),
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_implicit_alignment`. This is
the same pattern as in the verbal reliability condition above and in
Experiment 2. Further, the linear NPV trend was not significantly different
between reliability amount conditions in both the low alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_low_reliability_type_implicit_reliability_amount`,
and high alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_implicit_reliability_amount`.
This shows that participants did not use numerical reliability to moderate their
allocations.
