### Results

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV amount,
alignment, NPV reliability amount, and NPV reliability type on participants’
project allocations. Figure \@ref(fig:plot-alignment-8-allocation) shows these
data. Only the main results are reported here, while the rest of the
hypothesised allocation effects are reported in
Appendix \@ref(results-alignment-8-allocation).

The four-way interaction (alignment $\times$ reliability amount $\times$ NPV
amount $\times$ reliability type) was not significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$four_way`. Further, the three-way interaction
(alignment $\times$ reliability amount $\times$ NPV amount) in the verbal
reliability condition was not significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_explicit_three_way`. This is
most likely due to the size of the two-way interactions in each alignment
condition being relatively similar, despite the expectation of no interaction in
the low alignment condition (as was seen in [Experiment
1](#results-alignment-2)). In high alignment, this interaction (between the
linear NPV amount trend and NPV reliability amount) was significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount`.
Specifically, the trend was stronger in the high reliability amount condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount_high_npv_amount`,
than in the low reliability amount condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount_low_npv_amount`.
The same interaction was significant in the low alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_low_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount`.
Despite the lack of a three-way interaction in the verbal reliability condition
(indicating a difference in the two alignment two-way interactions), the linear
NPV amount trend was stronger in the low alignment condition than in the high
alignment condition when averaging over reliability amount,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_explicit_alignment`.

In the numerical reliability condition, the linear NPV amount trend was not
significantly "equivalent" between those in the low and high alignment
conditions (averaging over reliability amount),
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_implicit_alignment_null`. In
fact, a post-hoc comparison suggests that the low alignment trend was stronger
(with Bonferroni adjustment),
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_implicit_alignment`. Further,
the difference between the linear NPV trend was not significantly different
between reliability amount conditions in both the low alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_low_reliability_type_implicit_reliability_amount`,
and high alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_implicit_reliability_amount`.
This replicates the finding from [Experiment 2](results-alignment-3) that NPV is
used more in low alignment, but numerical reliability is ignored.
