### Results

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of NPV, project
alignment, NPV reliability level, and NPV reliability type on participants'
project allocations (see Figure \@ref(fig:plot-alignment-8-allocation) for the
main results and Appendix \@ref(results-alignment-8-allocation) for the
remainder of the hypothesised allocation effects). The predicted four-way
interaction (alignment $\times$ reliability level $\times$ NPV $\times$
reliability type) was not significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$four_way`. Regardless, the primary hypotheses
were supported, but realised in a different overall pattern than predicted,
elaborated below.

#### Verbal Reliability

The three-way interaction (alignment $\times$ reliability level $\times$ NPV
amount) in the verbal reliability condition was not significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_explicit_three_way`. This is
because NPV reliability interacted with NPV in both alignment conditions.
This is a different pattern from Experiment 1 where there was no effect of NPV
reliability in the low alignment condition. In the high alignment condition, the
interaction between the linear NPV trend and NPV reliability level was
significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount`.
Specifically, the trend was stronger for the high reliability condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount_high_npv_amount`,
compared with the low reliability level condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount_low_npv_amount`.
This shows that, similar to Experiment 1, participants modified their
allocations depending on verbally expressed NPV reliability. In low alignment,
there was also an interaction between the linear NPV trend and NPV reliability
level,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_low_reliability_type_explicit_reliability_amount`.
This suggests that participants also modified their allocations according to
verbal reliability in the low alignment condition.

However, another aspect of the data suggests a greater use of NPV in the low
alignment condition. The linear NPV trend was stronger in the low
alignment condition than in the high alignment condition when averaged over
reliability level,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_explicit_alignment`. This
suggests that when NPV reliability was expressed verbally, similar to
Experiment 1, participants relied more on NPV when projects were dissimilar than
when they were similar.

Overall, participants used NPV less when it was described as less reliable in
both high and low alignment conditions, and further, used NPV more when projects
were less alignable regardless of how reliable NPV was described to be.

#### Numerical Reliability

The numerical reliability data were analysed differently to the verbal
reliability data because of the different hypothesised effects. The two effects
of interest here were the alignment and reliability effects. In the numerical
reliability condition, it was hypothesised that the linear NPV trend would be
equivalent between those in the low and high alignment conditions, averaged
over reliability level. However, this effect was not significant,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_implicit_alignment_null`.
Indeed, a post-hoc comparison suggests that the low alignment trend was stronger
in the low alignment condition (with Bonferroni adjustment),
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$reliability_type_implicit_alignment`. This
pattern was the same as that found for the verbal reliability condition above
and in Experiment 2. Further, the linear NPV trend was not significantly
different between the reliability level conditions for both the low alignment
condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_low_reliability_type_implicit_reliability_amount`,
and high alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_8$allocation$alignment_high_reliability_type_implicit_reliability_amount`.
This indicates that participants did not use numerical NPV reliability to
moderate their allocations.

```

Similar to the verbal reliability condition, the use of NPV was stronger in the
low alignment condition than it was in the high alignment condition. However,
unlike the verbal reliability condition, participants did not moderate their use
of NPV based on numerical reliability in either the low or the high alignment
condition. In the verbal reliability condition, they moderated their choices in
both alignment conditions.
