### Discussion

Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2),
and \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2) were supported. This shows
that while overall participants prefer to use NPV as a proxy for project quality
in their allocations, they still use verbal reliability information.
Specifically, when projects are similar, people use NPV when they are told that
it is reliable, and use alternative metrics when told that it is not reliable.
However, Experiment 3 did not find evidence for
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2). Instead, I found
that even in the low alignment condition, participants were still able to use
NPV more when told that it was reliable.

Further, I did not find support for Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:four-way-alignment-8).
The hypothesis was constructed in response to the results of a pilot study
(documented in Appendix \@ref(alignment-7)) that replicated the results of
Experiment 1 in the verbal reliability condition, but did not replicate the
results of Experiment 2 in the numerical reliability condition. That is, I found
that when faced with numerical ranges as variance information, people did not
seem to even use the midpoint in their decisions. In Experiment 3, on the other
hand, I replicated the finding of Experiment 2 in the numerical reliability
condition. Specifically, I found that people used NPV more when projects were
dissimilar, but critically, that they did not use numerical range information to
moderate their allocations.
