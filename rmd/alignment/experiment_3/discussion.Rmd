### Discussion

Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:three-way-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2),
and \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2) were supported in the
verbal reliability condition. This shows that, while overall participants prefer
to use NPV as a proxy for project quality in their allocations, they still use
verbal reliability information. Specifically, when projects are similar, people
use NPV when they are told that it is reliable, and use alternative metrics more
so when told that it is not reliable. However, Experiment 3 did not find
evidence for Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2).
Instead, Experiment 3 found that even in the low alignment condition,
participants still moderated their use of NPV. They still used NPV regardless of
reliability condition, shown by the positive NPV amount trend in both
reliability conditions. However, Experiment 3 shows that participants used NPV
less when told that it was unreliable.

Further, Experiment 3 did not find support for
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:four-way-alignment-8) mostly likely because of the
unexpected effects of NPV amount in the numerical reliability condition. The
hypothesis was constructed in response to the results of a pilot study
(documented in Appendix \@ref(alignment-7)) that replicated the results of
Experiment 1 in the verbal reliability condition, but did not replicate the
results of Experiment 2 in the numerical reliability condition. That is, when
faced with numerical ranges as variance information, people did not seem to even
use the midpoint in their decisions. Experiment 3, on the other hand, replicated
the finding of Experiment 2 in the numerical reliability condition.
Specifically, people used NPV more when projects were dissimilar, but
critically, they did not use numerical range information to moderate their
allocations.
