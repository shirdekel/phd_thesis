### Discussion

Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:three-way-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-alignment-2), \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2),
and \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2) were supported in the
verbal reliability condition. This shows that, while overall participants
preferred to use NPV as a proxy for project quality in their allocations, they
still used verbal reliability information. Specifically, when projects were
similar, participants used NPV when they were told that it was reliable, and
used alternative metrics when told that it was not reliable. However, in
Experiment 3, no support was found for
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2). It was expected that
participants in the low alignment condition would use NPV regardless of the
reliability level conditions, as in Experiment 1. Rather, they used NPV less
when told that it was unreliable. However, they primarily used NPV overall, as
shown by the positive NPV trend in both reliability level conditions.

Further, Experiment 3 replicated the finding of Experiment 2 for the numerical
reliability condition. Specifically, participants relied more on NPV when
projects were dissimilar but, critically, did not use numerical range
information to influence their allocations. A pilot study (documented in
Appendix \@ref(alignment-7)) replicated the results of Experiment 1 in the
verbal reliability condition, but did not replicate the results of Experiment 2
in the numerical reliability condition. That is, when faced with numerical
ranges as the NPV reliability information, participants did not even use the
midpoint in their decisions. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that the
finding in the pilot experiment may have been spurious or due to an unexplored
component of the experimental design, but this can only be deteremined with
future research.
