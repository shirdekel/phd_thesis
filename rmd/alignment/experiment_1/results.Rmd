### Results

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and NPV reliability on participants’ allocations. As seen in
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-alignment-2-allocation), the alignment $\times$
reliability amount $\times$ NPV amount interaction was significant,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$alignment_reliability_amount_npv_amount`. The
analyses excluding the no NPV condition showed the expected results. The NPV
amount trend was higher in the low alignment condition than in the high
alignment condition, `r results_alignment_2$allocation$low_high_linear`,
averaging over reliability amount. This shows that people relied on NPV more
when projects were dissimilar than when they were similar.

Further, the NPV amount $\times$ reliability amount interaction was
stronger in the high alignment condition than in the low alignment condition,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$low_high_linear_low_high`. Specifically, in
high alignment, the NPV amount trend was higher in the high reliability
condition than in the low reliability condition,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$low_high_linear_high`, whereas in low
alignment, there was no significant difference between reliability conditions,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$low_high_linear_low`. This shows that people
only used the reliability information to moderate their allocations when
projects were similar and not when they were dissimilar.

The comparison with the no NPV condition revealed the expected pattern. In high
alignment, the linear NPV trend was only significantly lower in the no NPV
condition than the high reliability condition,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$high_noNPV_linear_high`, and not the low
reliability condition, `r results_alignment_2$allocation$low_noNPV_linear_high`.
However, in low alignment, the linear NPV trend was significantly lower in the
no NPV condition than both the low reliability condition,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$low_noNPV_linear_low`, and the high
reliability condition, `r results_alignment_2$allocation$high_noNPV_linear_low`.

(ref:plot-alignment-2-allocation) Mean allocation across NPV amount, by alignment and reliability amount conditions. In mixed factorial designs, error bars cannot be used to make inferences by "eye" across all conditions. Therefore, error bars are not included. Raw data are plotted in the background. When interpreting this figure, consider the linear trends in NPV amount.

The ranking, confidence, and forecast mean data were all largely congruent with
the allocation findings (see Appendix \@ref(results-alignment-2-appendix)). The
results also showed that forecasts of those in the low alignment condition had
higher standard deviations than those in the high alignment condition (see
Appendix \@ref(forecast-sd-alignment-2)). However, this did not replicate in
subsequent experiments (see Appendices \@ref(forecast-sd-alignment-4)
and \@ref(forecast-sd-alignment-5)).
