### Results

A mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of alignment
and verbally-instructed NPV reliability on participants’ allocations. As seen in
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-alignment-2-allocation), the alignment $\times$
reliability amount $\times$ NPV amount interaction was significant,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$alignment_reliability_amount_npv_amount`. This
effect seems to be driven by the differences between the no NPV condition and
the conditions with NPV across the two alignment conditions. Specifically, in
the low alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was significantly lower in the
no NPV condition than both the low reliability condition,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$low_noNPV_linear_low`, and the high
reliability condition, `r results_alignment_2$allocation$high_noNPV_linear_low`.
However, in the high alignment condition, the linear NPV trend was only
significantly lower in the no NPV condition than the high reliability condition,
`r results_alignment_2$allocation$high_noNPV_linear_high`, and not the low
reliability condition, `r results_alignment_2$allocation$low_noNPV_linear_high`.

The ranking, confidence, and forecast mean data were all largely congruent with
the allocation findings (see Appendix \@ref(results-alignment-2-appendix)). I
also found that the forecasts of those in the low alignment condition had higher
standard deviations than those in the high alignment condition (see
Appendix \@ref(forecast-sd-alignment-2)). However, this did not replicate in
subsequent experiments (see Appendix \@ref(forecast-sd-alignment-4)
and \@ref(forecast-sd-alignment-5)).
