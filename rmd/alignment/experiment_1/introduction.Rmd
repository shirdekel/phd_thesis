Experiment 1 investigated the effects of alignment and explicit NPV reliability
information on financial resource allocation decisions. The structural alignment
literature suggests that people weigh alignable differences more heavily than
non-alignable differences. It was expected that people would use NPV more than
any other product attributes (because it applied to every product). However,
this effect should vary with participants' perceived reliability of the value.
That is, if other project dimensions were alignable, then it should be easier to
adjust the use of NPV based on its reliability. However, it was predicted that
in a low alignment there will be a reliance on NPV, as the sole
alignable difference, regardless of its stated reliability. These effects were
measured by considering the linear trend of how NPV, across projects, relates to
the money allocated to the projects. Critically, participants saw both NPV and
other features intrinsic to each project domain, and these were inversely
related. Therefore, a positive NPV amount trend indicated a reliance on NPV,
whereas a negative trend indicated a reliance on the intrinsic project features.
First, Experiment 1 tested the following omnibus hypothesis:

``` {hypothesis, three-way-alignment-2, name = "Three way interaction", echo = TRUE}
The alignment $\times$ reliability amount $\times$ NPV amount interaction will
be significant.
```

Initially, the specific effects were tested excluding the no NPV condition.
Comparing across dissimilar projects will be difficult, so participants are
expected to rely on NPV more in such a scenario than when they have other
alignable attributes. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-alignment-2, name = "Alignment effect", echo = TRUE}
The linear NPV amount trend will be higher, on average, in low alignment
condition compared to high alignment.
```

Participants are likely to moderate their allocations based on the provided
reliability information. However, it is more likely that they will do this when
they have multiple options for metrics to use than when only NPV is
alignable. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2, name = "Moderation of NPV reliability by alignment", echo = TRUE}
The NPV amount $\times$ reliability interaction will be stronger in the high
alignment than in low alignment.
```

More specifically, it is expected that when projects are similar, participants
will rely on NPV more (positive NPV amount trend) when they are told that it is
reliable and rely more on the projects' intrinsic features (negative NPV amount
trend) when they are told that it is unreliable. However, when projects are
dissimilar, it is expected that participants will rely solely on NPV solely,
regardless of what they are told about its reliability. Therefore, Experiment 1
tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2, name = "NPV reliability in high alignment", echo = TRUE}
In high alignment, the linear NPV amount trend will be higher in
the high reliability condition than in the low reliability condition
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2, name = "NPV reliability in low alignment", echo = TRUE}
In low alignment, the linear NPV amount trend will not differ
significantly between reliability conditions
```

A no NPV condition was used to gain a better understanding of the baseline
responding to the materials without NPV. This was used to determine the extent
of participants' reliance on NPV. When projects were similar, this condition was
expected to be equivalent to the low reliability condition, as participants
disregard NPV. When projects were dissimilar, this condition was expected to
express the average participant value judgements for the project descriptions,
which should result in a more or less flat NPV amount trend. Therefore,
Experiment 1 tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-high-no-NPV-alignment-2, name = "No NPV comparison in high alignment", echo = TRUE}
In high alignment, the linear NPV amount trend will be higher in the high
reliability condition than the no NPV reliability condition.
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-low-no-NPV-alignment-2, name = "No NPV comparison in low alignment", echo = TRUE}
In low alignment, the linear NPV amount trend in both the low and high
reliability conditions will be higher than the no NPV reliability condition.
```
