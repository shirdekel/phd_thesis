Experiment 1 investigated the effects of alignment and explicit NPV reliability
information on financial resource allocation decisions. The structural alignment
literature suggests that people weigh alignable differences more heavily than
non-alignable differences. I expected that people would use NPV more than any
other product attributes (because it applied to every product). However, I
expected this effect to vary with how reliable participants thought the value
was. That is, if other project dimensions were alignable, then it should be
easier to adjust the use of NPV based on its reliability. However, I predicted
that in a low alignment condition there will be a reliance on NPV, as the sole
alignable difference, regardless of its stated reliability. I used a no NPV
condition in order to get a better understanding of the baseline responding to
the materials without NPV. To measure these effects I considered the linear
trend of how NPV across projects relates to the money allocated to the projects.
Critically, participants saw both NPV and other features intrinsic to each
project domain, and these were inversely related. Therefore, a positive NPV
amount trend indicates a reliance on NPV, whereas a negative trend indicates a
reliance on the intrinsic project features. Specifically, I tested the following
hypothesises:

``` {hypothesis, three-way-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
The alignment $\times$ reliability amount $\times$ NPV amount interaction will
be significant.
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
The linear NPV amount trend will be higher, on average, in the low alignment
condition compared to the high alignment condition.
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-reliability-npv-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
The effects of alignment, reliability amount, and NPV amount on allocations will
interact, such that the NPV amount $\times$ reliability interaction will be
stronger in the high alignment than in the low alignment condition.
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-high-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
In the high alignment condition, the linear NPV amount trend will be higher in
the high reliability condition than in the low reliability condition
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-low-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
In the low alignment condition, the linear NPV amount trend will not differ
significantly between reliability conditions
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-high-no-NPV-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
In the high alignment condition, the linear NPV amount trend will only be higher
than the no NPV reliability condition in the high reliability condition.
```

``` {hypothesis, allocation-alignment-low-no-NPV-alignment-2, echo = TRUE}
In the low alignment condition, the linear NPV amount trend will be higher than
the no NPV reliability condition in both the low and high reliability
conditions.
```
