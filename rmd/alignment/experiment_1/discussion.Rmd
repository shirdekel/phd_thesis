### Discussion

Experiment 1 found evidence for the effect of alignment on laypeople’s
decision-making in resource allocation scenarios. Specifically, when projects
were comparable, people used NPV when they were told that it was reliable, but
not when they were told that it was unreliable. However, they used NPV
regardless of reliability when it was the only shared dimension across products.

Experiment 1 manipulated *verbal* NPV reliability. That is, participants were
explicitly told whether NPV was considered to be a reliable metric or not.
However, in the real-world the reliability of a metric is more commonly
expressed in numerical form, such as a range around and estimate. Experiment 2
will attempt to replicate the alignment effects, but while manipulating the
*numerical* NPV reliability associated with each project, rather than the verbal
reliability as used in Experiment 2. Further, people with sufficient experience
with financial theory and analysis might be able to successfully draw inferences
from such information. Therefore, Experiment 2 used a sample of Masters of
Management students, instead of the laypeople used in Experiment 1.
