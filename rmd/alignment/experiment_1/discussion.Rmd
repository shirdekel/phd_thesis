### Discussion

Experiment 1 found evidence for the effect of alignment on laypeopleâ€™s
decision-making in resource allocation scenarios. Specifically, I found that
when projects are comparable, people use NPV when they are told it is reliable,
but not when they are told it is unreliable. However, they use NPV regardless of
reliability when it is the only shared dimension across products.

In Experiment 1 I manipulated *verbal* NPV reliability. That is, participants
were explicitly told whether NPV is considered to be a reliable metric or not.
However, in the real-world the reliability of a metric is more commonly
expressed in numerical form, such as a range around and estimate. In Experiment
2 I will attempt to replicate the alignment effects, but while manipulating the
numerical reliability associated with each project, rather than the verbal
reliability as I have previously used. Further, it might be the case that only
those with sufficient experience with financial theory and analysis will be able
to successfully draw inferences from such information. Therefore, in Experiment
2 I used a sample of Masters of Management students, instead of the laypeople in
Experiment 1.
