# Looking for alignment in past cases {#interstitial-2}

Chapter \@ref(alignment) found that people do not sufficiently weigh the
importance of numerical variance information in capital allocation. This is
important for when projects are dissimilar because people might not pay
attention to the differing variance that underlies NPV across different domains.
However, there are also implications for high alignment scenarios. When projects
are alignable this means that managers are likely to have a choice of using both
abstract metrics as well as intrinsic project features. Managers may use a
metric such as NPV, whose variance may suggest a lack of reliability, despite
being able to use intrinsic projects features. They may therefore miss out on an
opportunity to use different, potentially more reliable measures.

An evaluation of a non-alignable set of projects can therefore lead to many
potential pitfalls. Such a situation is likely to occur in most hierarchical
organisations and be more common the more the organisation is diversified.
Chapter \@ref(interstitial-1) discussed that a solution to managers not
aggregating the risk of multiple projects is a concurrent evaluation of projects
as a portfolio. However, the solution to the evaluation of dissimilar project in
the case of a diversified organisation is likely to involve significantly more
difficult structural changes in the organisation. For instance, this may mean
divesting certain divisions of the organisation, as GE has been doing over the
last few years [@scott2018].

Other solutions are also possible. For instance, organisations can develop a
more normative use of metrics and take into account underlying uncertainty.
However, this kind of change might require substantially more statistical
reasoning abilities than can be expected of managers without better decision
guidelines. Another solution managers may use is to look to evidence from
similar projects from outside the organisation. This is useful because a
diversified organisation may not have enough points of reference for a project
proposal within it. Doing this both does not require substantial restructuring
of the organisation as in divestment and is already an on-going practice, as
opposed to aiming to facilitate managers' statistical reasoning.

Evidence from similar projects may come in the form of an individual case study
from another organisation, or a research report that describes a statistical
result. Case studies are especially important in managerial decision-making
since they are used extensively in business school teaching materials.
Therefore, managers are likely to look to case studies to inform their
decisions. But would they think that a single case study is more useful than
statistical data? The literature on anecdotal bias suggests that they might.
Therefore, Chapter \@ref(anecdotes) considers the influence of an anecdote on
project allocation when it conflicts with statistical evidence.

Previous work showed that people often do not give evidence appropriate
weighting in their decisions [@griffin1992]. Anecdotal and statistical evidence
are potentially conflicting sources of evidence, so it is important to
appropriately weigh their influence when making a decision. It is possible for
these sources of evidence to conflict because statistical estimates commonly
refer to the mean value of a distribution, whereas individual cases may be
sampled, for instance, from either tail of the distribution. This kind of
comparison would give the appearance of conflicting information, especially if
the distribution is skewed. In the same way that in Chapter \@ref(alignment) the
intrinsic project features conflicted with the abstract financial metric, in
Chapter \@ref(anecdotes) the description of an anecdote conflicted with the
financial metrics of the target project.

Chapter \@ref(anecdotes) considered how people dealt with such conflicting
information. That is, would they focus on one metric or use a trade-off? In the
previous chapter, people did not seem to predominantly use one cue or another.
The fact that those in the low alignment condition relied on NPV more than those
in the high alignment condition means that those in the high alignment condition
were still referring to the intrinsic project features to some extent.
Specifically, the different measures' influence may have been integrated in a
form of trade-off. However, there was no clear way of determining this, because
the allocation measure was aggregated in the analysis. Chapter \@ref(anecdotes),
however, set up the conditions so that it was possible to determine whether
participants were using anecdotes exclusively, partially, or not at all.
