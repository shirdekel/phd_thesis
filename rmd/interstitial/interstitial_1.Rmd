# Joint evaluation of multiple projects {#interstitial-1}

Chapter \@ref(aggregation) found that people struggle to aggregate risk even
when facilitated to do so intuitively. People instead tend to consider projects
one at a time and only become aware of the benefits of aggregation when given an
explicit visualisation of what it entails. In real-life resource allocation
scenarios, when managers evaluate projects sequentially, presenting an
aggregated distribution is not possible since the value of future projects is
not yet known. Managers in this situation would need to aggregate intuitively by
considering that for positive EV projects, some gains will win out overall.
However, this is insufficient if their supervising manager is unaware of this
principle. The usual incentive structure in organisations that judges each
project outcome independently is likely to punish risk taking due to its
potential negative consequences and not due to the information that was
available at the time of evaluation. Therefore, changing the organisational
policy to encourage considering projects jointly is important so that the risk
can be concurrently aggregated. Considering projects jointly is useful both
because it allows for an actual aggregation of the risks, and also because it
frames the projects as portfolios, meaning that any subsequent success or
failure of one project can be traced back to the entire batch, and the
performance of the whole portfolio can be evaluated.

Business projects might not always be either accepted or rejected. Instead, an
organisation might have a initial "culling" phase, and a subsequent ranking
phase. When initially considering a set of projects some might be rejected
according to certain rules, for instance, if NPV does not meet a certain minimum
cut-off. The remaining projects in the set can then be ranked in order of
priority and receive an allocation of resources from the budget.

A few potential problems arise at the point that projects are considered jointly
for ranking and allocation. For instance, it might not be easy to compare
between the projects in the set. As discussed in Chapter \@ref(introduction),
diversification of business units has become very popular in large
organisations. Therefore, most hierarchical organisations are likely to face
difficult comparisons when deciding on how to rank and allocate resources to
projects that originated in different divisions. A non-hierarchical organisation
that develops one type of product may be able to simply compare across any
number of intrinsic project attributes, whereas a diversified organisation is
likely to have to rely on more abstract financial metrics, such as NPV.
 
For instance, when comparing across two oil well projects, there can be both
attributes intrinsic to the project, such as the amount of hydrocarbons that are
extracted per hour, and also the more abstract financial metrics. There is a
potential interaction between the ease that managers have to compare across the
projects and the kinds of measures that are used to make the comparison. Two
similar projects, such as two oil wells can be evaluated across litres of
hydrocarbons per hour, whereas an oil refinery cannot. In the case that two
dissimilar projects are compared managers can use financial metrics to compare
across domains. This can lead to comparable accuracy insofar as the abstract
metrics are as reliable as the intrinsic project features.

A concern that arises out of a reliance on such metrics is that underlying
variance is not taken into account. Forecast estimates such as NPV rely on many
assumptions and contain much inherent uncertainty, so managers that use them
should be cautious about over-relying on them. Chapter \@ref(alignment) tested
people's sensitivity to forecast estimate variance information. That is, will
people use NPV more when the variance information suggests that it is a reliable
measure, than when the information suggests that it is unreliable?

In the previous chapter I manipulated project presentation and found no
significant difference between when projects were considered jointly or
separately. This was explained by the bounds on people's ability to intuitively
aggregate. However, it was unclear what components of the projects people
focused on both because they were not explicitly manipulated and because the
task involved a binary choice (accept or reject). A relative allocation measure
for multiple projects with systematically varied attributes would allow to
determine the influence of those different attributes. Therefore,
Chapter \@ref(alignment) considered the situation in which people are already
presented with choices together and asked to evaluate the projects by allocating
a hypothetical budget.

Further, I wanted to focus on identifying the factors that affect people's
decisions independently from the potential risk of losing hypothetical money,
which is a large reason for the effects in the previous chapter. Therefore, risk
aversion was accounted for by making it clear that no losses are possible. This
was achieved by using only positive NPVs, which implies that the project is not
forecasted to lose money.

I also manipulated how easy the project attributes are to compare in order to
identify the ways that decision-making in a diversified organisation might be
different to that of a more integrated organisation. In the previous chapter I
manipulated "similarity" by either showing a set of projects from the same
industry or a set from different industries. This was meant to simulate an
integrated and diversified firm, respectively. I assumed that participants
understood that the dissimilar project set implied that the projects were not
alignable. That is, even though the underlying specific project features were
not shown, I assumed that participants would realise that two projects from the
same industry would be easier to compare using their intrinsic underlying
features. However, this may not have been the case and may explain the equivocal
similarity effect. Therefore, Chapter \@ref(alignment) will show the project
features explicitly and manipulate alignment, so that the difficulty of the
comparison is more obvious.
