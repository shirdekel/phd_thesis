This thesis investigated the psychology of resource allocation decisions. The
influence of psychological factors on such decisions has not been sufficiently
considered in the literature despite its importance to the performance of
hierarchical organisations. This discrepancy is likely due to a greater focus of
the role of organisational influences on firm performance in the management
literature. The thesis did not investigate expertise effects, but instead
focused largely on participants without management experience. This allowed a
study of the specific cognitive processes without the potential confound of
experience. Each of the empirical chapters investigated distinct but related
processes that are relevant to the resource allocation process. By doing this I
was able to investigate whether people are able to account for the benefits of
aggregation when considering multiple projects (Chapter \@ref(aggregation)), the
influence of project feature alignability and metric variance when comparing
projects directly (Chapter \@ref(alignment)), and the influence of project
anecdote similarity when the anecdote conflicts with statistical evidence
(Chapter \@ref(anecdotes)). I will first summarise the results of the empirical
chapters and then discuss their theoretical and practical implications. Though,
it is also worth noting that in the one case where the work examined people with
management experience, the pattern of results was largely the same as with naive
participants.

## Summary of results

Chapter \@ref(aggregation) investigated the choice of risky business projects
that are displayed sequentially and without feedback in between decisions. This
design modelled the real-life situation that managers are faced with in
hierarchical organisations: an evaluation of a set of separate business project
proposals over time with no immediate indication of the performance of those
projects. Aggregating a portfolio of such projects is likely to show a lower
chance of potential loss overall than might be originally assumed. The results
from this chapter showed that people not only did not do this spontaneously, but
also were not facilitated by manipulations that encouraged grouping choices
together as a portfolio. People only seemed to recognise the benefits of
aggregation when they were presented with an outcome probability distribution of
the aggregated set of projects. There was no strong evidence that more subtle
manipulations aimed at encouraging aggregation worked. Specifically, presenting
projects together, specifying the total number of projects, and presenting
projects that were all from the same industry did not encourage aggregation.

Chapter \@ref(alignment) investigated resource allocation when projects were
evaluated jointly and capital was allocated as a proportion of the budget,
rather than a binary choice. I manipulated whether all the project attributes
were alignable, or only the abstract financial metric (NPV) was alignable. I
also manipulated whether NPV was to be considered a reliable metric or not, and
whether this information was expressed as explicit verbal instruction or as
numerical ranges. The results showed that when reliability information was
presented verbally, participants used it appropriately when all project
attributes were completely alignable. That is, they used it when it was reliable
and used the intrinsic project features when it was unreliable. When only NPV
was alignable, participants relied on it regardless of the reliability
information. However, when reliability information was presented numerically,
there was no moderation of allocation based on the ranges---participants used
NPV even when they had an opportunity to use the intrinsic features of the
project. Overall, however, participants tended to rely on NPV more in the low
alignment condition than in the high alignment condition.

Chapter \@ref(anecdotes) investigated the effect of anecdote similarity on
allocations when anecdote conflicted with statistical data. Participants were
asked to allocate a hypothetical budget between two projects. One of the
projects was clearly superior in terms of the provided statistical measures, but
some of the participants also saw a description of a project with a conflicting
outcome. This anecdotal project was always in the same industry as one of the
target projects. However, the anecdote description either contained substantive
connections to the target or not. I also manipulated whether the anecdote
conflicted with the statistical measures because it was successful (positive
anecdote) or unsuccessful (negative anecdote). The results showed that
participants' decisions were influenced by anecdotes only when they believed
that they were actually relevant to the target project. Further, they still
incorporated the statistical measures into their decision. I found this for both
positive and negative anecdotes. However, participants were given information
about the way that the anecdotes were sampled that suggested that the
statistical information should have been used in all cases. Participants did not
use this information in their decision and still showed an anecdotal bias
effect. Therefore, people seem to appropriately moderate their use of anecdotes
based on the anecdotes' relevance, but do not understand the implications of
more complex statistical principles.

Together, these results show the bounds of people's decision-making capability
in resource allocation. The participants in these experiments in general behaved
rationally but struggled to incorporate more advanced statistical principles
into their decisions. Further, when confronted with multi-attribute choice,
participants tended to allocate resources using a trade-off strategy. This was
seen in the conflict between intrinsic project attributes and NPV in
Chapter \@ref(alignment) and the conflict between the anecdotal and statistical
evidence in Chapter \@ref(anecdotes). Participants were able to moderate their
allocations when the moderating factors were sufficiently clear (as in the
verbal reliability condition in Chapter \@ref(alignment)). However, participants
struggled to do this when the moderating factor involved an understanding of a
more advanced statistical principle. Each empirical chapter included such a
principle: risk aggregation in Chapter \@ref(aggregation), metric variance in
Chapter \@ref(alignment), and sample distribution in Chapter \@ref(alignment).
However, a formal understanding of such principles does not seem to be necessary
if they are expressed explicitly (as in the aggregated distribution in
Chapter \@ref(aggregation)).
