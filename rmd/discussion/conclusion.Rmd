## Conclusion

Resource allocation decisions can be consequential for large organisations.
Therefore, this thesis tested the conditions under which people behave
rationally or are fallible when allocating resources. The experiments found that
people struggle to incorporate concepts such as risk aggregation, estimate
variance, and sample distribution into their decisions. People only seemed to be
able to do this when the concept was expressed visually very explicitly.
However, when there were multiple cues for choice evaluation, the results also
showed that people were capable of integrating conflicting information in their
decisions. Identifying such cognitive bounds helped to both better understand
how people evaluate multiple choices and future research can use this work to
develop methods to facilitate better decisions.
