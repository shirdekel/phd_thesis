## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Capital allocation decisions can be consequential for large organisations. This
thesis tested the conditions under which people behave rationally or are
fallible when allocating capital. The experiments found that people struggle to
incorporate concepts such as risk aggregation, estimate variance, and sample
distribution into their decisions. People only seemed to be able to do this when
the concept was expressed visually very explicitly. However, when there were
multiple cues for choice evaluation, the results also showed that people were
capable of integrating conflicting information in their decisions. Identifying
such cognitive bounds helps to better understand how people evaluate multiple
choices and helps future research to develop methods to facilitate better
decisions.
