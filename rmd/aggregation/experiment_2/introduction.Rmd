## Experiment 2

Experiment 2 investigated the effect of presentation, awareness, and
distribution on project choice. For the distribution manipulation, I presented
half of the sample an outcome probability distribution as in the previous
literature [e.g., @redelmeier1992; @webb2017] to determine their risk aversion
when the gambles are explicitly aggregated. In contrast to repeated-play choice
literature, each choice was presented without feedback. Further, in contrast to
Experiment 1, I displayed this distribution alongside each gamble, as opposed to
only at the very end. This is an important manipulation because finding out
whether it is effective will 1. add to the understanding of the conditions
necessary for mathematical aggregation (beyond a mere intuitive sense of
aggregation), and 2. suggest new ways to encourage aggregation in real-world
applications.

In past work, participants were shown ordinary binomial distributions, since
multi-play gambles are identical. To my knowledge, there has not been an
investigation of *non-identical* gamble distributions in this context. Doing
this requires using a *Poisson* binomial distribution, which allows for multiple
trials with different probabilities.

Further, I addressed one of the limitations of Experiment 1 detailed
[above](#discussion-aggregation-1) by manipulating all the main variables
between-subjects. By manipulating presentation between-subjects, I take out the
potentially confounding factor of reduced risk aversion over time.

I tested Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:awareness-aggregation-1),
and \@ref(hyp:presentation-aggregation-1), from Experiment 1. Following the
finding in Experiment 1 that participants in the aware condition seemed to
become more risk-taking as the experiment progressed, I tested the following
hypothesis:

``` {hypothesis, awareness-trials-aggregation-2, echo = TRUE}
Participants will make more risky choices as the trials progress, but only when
they are aware of the total number of projects in the set.
```

Further, multi-play gambles with outcome distributions have been shown to reduce
risk aversion compared to multi-play gambles without distributions [e.g.,
@redelmeier1992; @webb2017]. Therefore, I tested the following hypothesis:

``` {hypothesis, distribution-aggregation-2, echo = TRUE}
Participants will make more risky choices when presented with an aggregated
outcome distribution than when making the same decisions individually.
```
