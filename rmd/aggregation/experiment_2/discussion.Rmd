### Discussion

I found support for one of the Experiment 2 hypotheses. Seeing an outcome
distribution of the projects had a strong effect on participants'
decision-making. Participants indicated that they would invest in more projects,
and were more likely to indicate that they would invest in the entire
"portfolio". However, the awareness and presentation effects I found in
[Experiment 1](#results-aggregation-1) did not replicate.

The finding that seeing an outcome distribution of a set of gambles reduces risk
aversion for that set of gambles provides evidence for choice bracketing. That
is, people do seem to be primarily considering gambles one at a time.
Specifically in this case, this finding suggests that that the main bottleneck
for appropriately aggregating a set of gambles is a mathematical/computational
one. That is, people simply cannot mentally combine the outcomes and
probabilities in a way that sufficiently approximates the outcome distribution
display.

The lack of replication of the awareness and presentation effects provides
evidence against a naive aggregation account of the distribution effect.
Specifically this suggests that the distribution effect is a result of a lack of
ability to mathematically combine risk, rather than naive aggregation. If some
of the bottleneck was attributable to a lack of realisation that the individual
gambles could be grouped/bracketed together, then the effects from Experiment 1
should have replicated. However, instead it seems that even when people have an
opportunity to consider an entire set of risky choices together (and consider
that the gains may outweigh the losses), they do not do this.

In Experiment 2, all the gambles came from the same domain. I did this in order
to attempt to replicate the relevant effects from Experiment 1. However, it may
be the case that there was something about that particular domain that led to
the lack of replication. A follow-up experiment addressed this issue by
presenting participants with 20 gambles from 10 different industries and still
did not replicate the awareness effect (see AppendixÂ \@ref(aggregation-4)).
