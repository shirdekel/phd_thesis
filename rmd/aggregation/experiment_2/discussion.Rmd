### Discussion {#discussion-aggregation-4}

Experiment 2 found support for
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:distribution-aggregation-2). Seeing an outcome
distribution of a business project portfolio had a strong effect on
participants' decision-making. Participants indicated that they would invest in
more projects and were more likely to indicate that they would invest in the
entire portfolio. However, the awareness and presentation effects found in
Experiment 1 (see Section \@ref(results-aggregation-1)) did not replicate.

These findings provide evidence for choice bracketing. That is, people do seem
to be primarily considering gambles one at a time. Further, these findings
suggest that that the main bottleneck for appropriately aggregating a set of
gambles is a computational one. That is, people simply cannot mentally combine
the outcomes and probabilities in a way that sufficiently approximates the
outcome distribution display.

The lack of replication of the awareness and presentation effects provides
evidence against a naive aggregation account of the distribution effect.
Specifically this suggests that the distribution effect is a result of a lack of
ability to mathematically combine risk, rather than naive aggregation. If some
of the bottleneck was attributable to a lack of realisation that the individual
gambles could be grouped together, then the effects from Experiment 1 should
have replicated. Instead it seems that even when people have an opportunity to
consider an entire set of risky choices together (and consider that the gains
may outweigh the losses), they do not do this.

In Experiment 2, all the gambles came from the same domain. This was done to
attempt to replicate the relevant effects from Experiment 1. However, there
could have been something about that particular domain that led to the lack of
replication. A follow-up experiment addressed this issue by presenting
participants with 20 gambles from 10 different industries and still did not
replicate the awareness effect (see Appendix \@ref(aggregation-4)).
