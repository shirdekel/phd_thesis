# Effect of Choice Bracketing on Risk Aggregation in Repeated-Play Gambles With no Feedback {#aggregation}

\chaptermark{Effect of choice bracketing on risk aggregation}

\minitoc

## Introduction

Investors know not to put all their eggs in one basket. Ever since work on
modern portfolio theory [@markowitz1952], it has been clear that combining the
risk of a set of individual investments reduces the overall risk of the
portfolio of investments. But what about situations in which it is not clear
that a set of investments fit together as a portfolio? Personal decisions such
as buying a car or moving cities are typically evaluated independently, as are
business decisions such as a farm investing in new cropping technology or a
multi-business firm building a mine.

While these decisions are separated in time, they are often not so far apart
that it is easy to learn from past outcomes (and sometimes the outcomes
themselves are unclear). This is because the outcomes of large investments are
often delayed. As such, the decision-maker cannot always use the knowledge of
the returns of one investment when evaluating a subsequent investment. Any
results that a farmer may identify from using a new technology will only become
apparent after many seasons of use. Similarly, it will take many years for a
multi-business firm to begin to estimate whether the output of a mine resulted
in the expected return on investment. These are the decisions that this chapter
investigates: sequences of large risky choices without immediate outcomes.

Risk aggregation is the combination of probability or variance information (or
both) associated with certain outcomes for the purpose of understanding that
information more comprehensively [@bjornsen2019]. However, the psychological
literature suggests that this process may be difficult for people to use. Work
on prospect theory [@kahneman1979] suggests that people's evaluation of gambles
does not conform to expected utility theory and is prone to framing effects.
Specifically, people typically evaluate gambles one by one [@rabin2009;
@tversky1981; @kahneman1993]. As such, it is unlikely that people will be able
to aggregate risk when they do not perceive a series of investments as a
portfolio. So, what would encourage people to aggregate risk? The literature on
*choice bracketing* [@read1999] shows that grouping a set of individual gambles
together facilitates risk aggregation. As such, the current work provides two
primary contributions. First, this work is the first to investigate the effect
of choice bracketing on risk aggregation in independent gambles evaluated
without immediate returns. Second, this work introduces novel choice bracketing
manipulations.

The earlier work on risk aggregation essentially did the aggregating work for
the participants. For example, experimenters provided participants with an
outcome probability distribution, usually with an explicit indication to group
the choices together, such as by asking for a single decision to be made on a
set of identical gambles. Other work addressed the more realistic situation of a
set of independent gambles. However, most of this work provided participants
with the outcomes of their choices before the subsequent choice. In these
paradigms participants experienced individual outcomes from the eventual outcome
distribution of the gambles, meaning that aggregation was confounded with
learning.

As mentioned above, in real-life there is usually a significant delay between
the choice a person or firm makes and the outcome of that choice, and there are
likely to be several interim choices in the meantime. This is especially true
for business executives, who would typically have to wait months or years before
beginning to understand the consequences of their decision, and even then the
outcome may be unclear. However, previous work did not investigate the effect of
choice bracketing on risky choice without feedback. This is surprising, since
choice bracketing is exactly the kind of process that should promote aggregation
in these more realistic decisions. As such, this chapter investigated new ways
of encouraging participants to bracket their risky choices, but with a paradigm
that involves a series of independent choices without feedback. In this way, the
paradigm is more isometric with real-life risky choice.

### Multi-Play Gambles

Despite the difficulties of risk aggregation, people seem to aggregate "naively"
when considering multiple gambles. @samuelson1963 told of a colleague who
rejected a gamble that involved a 50% chance of gaining $200 and a 50% of losing
$100, despite the gamble's positive Expected Value (EV). That is, $200 \cdot
0.5 - 100 \cdot 0.5 = 50$. Rejection of a positive EV gamble out of fear of the
possible loss is classic loss aversion. However, the same colleague said he
would accept 100 plays of the same gamble. Samuelson argued that this choice is
irrational.[^normative] Intuitively, it is clear that over the course of 100
gambles, the positive EV wins out, and a net loss of money is extremely
unlikely. Samuelson's colleague was more risk averse when making a single
decision about one gamble (a *single-play* gamble), than when making a single
decision about multiple (in this case 100) identical gambles (a *multi-play*
gamble).[^terminology]

[^normative]: Other work suggests that it is consistent with expected utility
    theory, once certain assumptions are added [e.g., @ross1999; @aloysius2007].
    However, a normative discussion is out of the scope of the present work.

[^terminology]: This chapter uses the terminology for gamble types used in
    @bristow2011, and @camilleri2013.

@wedell1994 replicated the @samuelson1963 anecdote experimentally with a gamble
involving a potential gain of $100 and a potential loss of $50. Participants
accepted the multi-play gamble of 100 plays more than the single-play gamble.
This effect has since been replicated with different outcomes and probabilities,
both with hypothetical and real money. Some participants often require fewer
than 10 plays of a previously rejected gamble in order to accept it [@dekay2005;
@keren1991; @montgomery1982; @redelmeier1992]. Other similar studies found a
multi-play effect that was in the predicted direction but not significant
[@barron2003; @benartzi1999; @klos2005; @langer2001]. Further, the effect is not
seen when participants do not perceive gamble outcomes as fungible [@dekay2006;
@dekay2005; @dekay2011] or when choice is continuous rather than discrete
[@bristow2011].

However, multi-play effects are likely robust, since there is also evidence that
such gambles reduce a variety of cognitive biases. These include common-ratio
effects [@keren1987; @keren1991; @dekay2006], preference reversals
[@wedell1990], ambiguity aversion [@liu2009], and the illusion of control
[@koehler1994]. Participants are also more likely to use explicitly provided EVs
in multi-play gambles [@li2003], show eye movements more congruent with an EV
model than single-play gambles [@su2013], and judge multi-play gambles as
riskier [@joag1990].

People prefer multi-play gambles that are displayed with an aggregated outcome
distribution of those gambles than those without [@benartzi1999;
@redelmeier1992; @klos2013; @webb2017; @coombs1971; @venkatraman2006;
@dekay2005; @langer2001; @keren1991]. This is because these distributions
present the probabilities of all the different possible outcomes, so very
clearly show the rarity of a loss. Note that this does not seems to hold when
returns are calculated as percentages, rather than fixed dollar amounts
[@stutzer2013]; and when participants do not perceive gamble outcomes as
fungible [@dekay2005]. However, when this effect is demonstrated, the multi-play
gamble is usually set up such that its (binomial) outcome distribution shows a
relatively low chance of losing any money and a very low chance of losing a lot
of money. For instance, FigureÂ \@ref(fig:samuelson-distribution-10) shows the
outcome distribution of the @samuelson1963 gamble played 10 times. Outcome
distributions of this sort do the aggregating work for the participants, making
the attractiveness of the multi-play gamble clearer. This work suggests that
participants can comprehend and respond to aggregated risk, but that they
struggle to compute the aggregation without external help.

(ref:samuelson-distribution-10) The outcome probability distribution of the @samuelson1963 gamble (50% chance of gaining $200 and a 50% of losing $100) played 10 times.

### Repeated-Play Gambles

Decisions in real life are usually sequential, and rarely identical as in the
multi-play paradigm [cf. @barron2003]. That is, people tend to be confronted
with individual choices whose outcomes and outcome probabilities are different
from one choice to another, and these choices occur at different points in time.
In a business setting this can be seen in decisions about whether to invest in
new projects; proposals and opportunities differ widely and occur at different
times. Managers are not ever simply asked: "here are 10 identical investments to
consider; do you want all or none of them?"

In *repeated-play* (rather than multi-play) gamble paradigms, participants make
decisions about a series of individual gambles. Research using this paradigm
found that people are less risk averse both when outcomes for a series of
gambles are evaluated less frequently and the subsequent decisions are made less
frequently [@gneezy1997; @thaler1997; @bellemare2005; @beshears2016]. People are
also less risk averse (for positive EV gambles) when they receive feedback after
each decision or are able to sample from the distribution of possible outcomes
before making a choice [@camilleri2011; @camilleri2013; @barron2003; @wulff2018;
@ludvig2011; @hertwig2004; @jessup2008]. Other work found that loss aversion is
mitigated when people are explicitly instructed to consider the options as a
part of a portfolio [@sokolhessner2009; @sokolhessner2012].

These studies are closer to real-life decisions than the multi-play gamble
paradigm, because they involve a set of separate gamble decisions, rather than a
single decision about a set of gambles. However, for the most part, the
experiments used in the repeated-play gamble literature use various forms of
feedback throughout the course of the experiment. That is, participants are
shown the outcomes of their gambles before they make more decisions. This
paradigm is known as *experience-based choice*. In *description-based choice*,
on the other hand, the gamble is simply presented to the participant without any
feedback, as in the multi-play gambles above. In real life, people rarely see
the immediate outcomes of their risky choices, and even less so in business
settings, where any return on investment often takes years to manifest.

Only a limited number of studies have used a repeated-play paradigm without
feedback. For instance, @jessup2008 and @hertwig2004 investigated the effects of
feedback in repeated-play gambles on the weighting of small probabilities, and
had a no-feedback control condition. Other work similarly used individual
description-based gambles presented sequentially [e.g., @ert2013; @joag1990].
However, these studies did not attempt to facilitate participants' risk
aggregation. @haisley2008 provided limited evidence for facilitating risk
aggregation. They gave participants the opportunity to buy five (negative EV)
lottery tickets, and either presented them one at a time, or together.
Participants bought fewer tickets, when they considered them jointly, thereby
maximising EV. However, the experimenters did not specify the outcomes and
probabilities of each gamble, meaning that it is unclear if participants
understood the independent lotteries as identical or non-identical. This reduces
the external validity of the study, as most independent risky choice involves
non-identical outcomes and probabilities. In sum, these studies were not
designed to research how to facilitate risk aggregation and reduce loss
aversion. This chapter is novel because its goal is to facilitate risk
aggregation without the experimental artefact of immediate feedback.

### Choice Bracketing

Research in psychology and economics has identified ways of facilitating risk
aggregation by encouraging people to group their choices. Specifically, people
aggregate more when they consider the consequences of their choices together
(broad bracketing) than when they consider them individually [narrow
bracketing\; @read1999]. In multi-play gambles (especially when displayed with
an outcome distribution), choices are inherently bracketed broadly because a
single choice is made about multiple gambles. Similarly, studies that used
repeated-play gambles facilitated risk-tolerance through what can in hindsight
be considered broad bracketing. For instance, when @thaler1997 presented gamble
outcomes less frequently, they allowed participants to consider longer time
increments with a single evaluation.

<!-- Naive aggregation -->

Both the original @samuelson1963 anecdote and its subsequent replications show
that people do have an intuition for aggregation even without the risk being
calculated exactly for them. This chapter tests whether that same intuition can
be elicited and applied across sets of unique bets. What are the minimal
conditions required to encourage aggregation? The multi-play gamble work
suggests that participants can engage in a more intuitive form of aggregation
when provided with the right contextual cues. Investigating the effects of more
subtle cues will help shed light on the cognitive processes underlying choice
bracketing. Of course, the effects of more subtle cues would not eliminate the
utility of explicit financial education, but they will help the design of
decision-making contexts to best align with such instruction.

<!-- Awareness -->

One way of potentially facilitating risk aggregation is to highlight to
participants the number of total options that are available to them.
@sokolhessner2009 and @sokolhessner2012 reduced risk aversion using lengthy
instructions that encouraged participants to "think like a trader". This meant
considering all the repeated-play gambles as a portfolio, as opposed to
considering them individually. However, this was quite a strong manipulation
that is perhaps unrealistic in real world. A more subtle cue could involve
simply making participants aware that they are going to be making a series of
choices. If people possess an intuitive understanding of aggregation, as
suggested above, then this kind of contextual cue will also facilitate
aggregation.

<!-- Alignment -->

In addition to simply informing participants that they will make a series of
choices, making the choices more readily comparable may facilitate broad
bracketing, and thus risk aggregation. Consider the inverse situation wherein a
lack of comparability between choices may prevent broad bracketing, such as when
an executive for a multi-business firm makes decisions across multiple distinct
industries. Of course, the similarity of decision contexts does not change the
maths of risk aggregation, but may well affect whether people do aggregate risk
across decisions. @dekay2005 found that multi-play effects are not seen when
choices are not considered fungible. For instance, participants aggregated
across dollar amounts, but not across patients in a medical decision. As such,
people may behave similarly when considering a set of dissimilar choices if they
do not consider them fungible.

There is further suggestive evidence that the similarity of a set of choices to
one another will affect choice bracketing. Choices whose differences are easy to
compare (alignable differences) are weighted heavier than those that are
difficult to compare [@markman1995; @markman2010]. Increased similarity across a
set of choices may both highlight the ability for those choices to be bracketed,
and further facilitate risk aggregation through the comparable attributes.
However, it is possible that increased similarity will facilitate risk
aggregation even without a tangible benefit to the underlying calculations. That
is, it is possible that simply manipulating the similarity of
financially-irrelevant semantics of a choice set will make people less risk
averse. If so, then this will be by virtue of an implicit risk aggregation in
which the mere awareness of the possibility of a grouping of choices reduces
risk aversion. It is important to investigate the effect of similarity
especially because in managerial settings, executives in multi-business firms
will often have to make comparisons across industries that are hard to compare.
For instance, General Electric currently develops both analytic software
products and jet engines for the military. They had been even more diversified
previously, at one stage simultaneously developing home appliances and owning
the NBC television network.

<!-- Presentation -->

In addition to the similarity between choices, how choices are presented may
affect how easily they are compared, and thus whether or not the multiple
subsequent effects listed above would come to fruition. As mentioned above,
@haisley2008 found a higher degree of EV maximisation when gambles were
presented jointly, rather than separately. Similarly, @hsee1999 found that
people's choices were affected by whether they viewed the attributes of the
choices separately or jointly. Their *evaluability hypothesis* suggests that
attributes that are difficult to evaluate will have a greater impact on joint
presentation than separate presentation. Joint presentation is a form of broad
bracketing because it forces a participant to view of all the components of a
decision together. Participants may therefore be more likely to consider
aggregating the risk involved in a set of choices when all those choices are in
view. Joint presentation potentially reduces the working memory load otherwise
needed to maintain that set of choices. As such, it is quite possible that a
combination of highly similar choices, presented jointly will lead to the
highest likelihood of broad bracketing, and thus risk aggregation.

@moher2010 replicated @gneezy1997, but separately manipulated the number of
gambles seen per trial and feedback frequency. They found that participants were
less risk averse when viewing a set of three gambles per trial, than when
viewing only one. However, they only found this effect with a set of identical
outcomes. When outcomes were non-identical, there was no effect of presentation.
However, participants were always presented with gamble outcomes for each trial,
so it is unclear to what extent this influenced participants' ability to bracket
broadly. In fact, when seeing gambles separately, participants were less risk
averse when receiving feedback for each trial, compared to every three trials.
Testing a presentation manipulation without the confound of feedback will help
to clarify this effect.

### Internal Capital Market Investment Context

Executives of large, successful firms are often viewed as fearless risk-takers
who take on risky projects to generate innovation and growth. However, the
available evidence suggests that executives do not view themselves that way
[@swalm1966; @march1987]. Executives typically evaluate multiple investments
over time. Risk aggregation is sensible when investments are only partially
correlated (i.e., the success of one does not influence the success of another).
It is sensible to take on a set of risky investments with positive EV, where
each investment has some chance of loss, because those that succeed will make up
for those that failed. These benefits are well-known in stock market investment
settings, thanks to Nobel laureate Harry Markowitzâs work on modern portfolio
theory [-@markowitz1952].

However, it is unclear whether the general public and even business managers use
this concept, due to the extent of risk aversion in both those populations
[e.g., @tversky1992; @march1987]. In fact, executives treat risk like the rest
of us; they view investments one at a time, are risk averse in the domain of
gains, and are risk seeking in the domain of losses [@maccrimmon1986;
@swalm1966; @lovallo2020]. However, it is understandable why risk aggregation is
foreign to most people; outside of an investment portfolio selection situation,
it is unlikely for people to spontaneously group a selection of individual risky
choices. Usually in life, people encounter risky choices sequentially, and so
the risk of each individual choice is more salient than the aggregated risk of
an arbitrary combination of choices.

@lovallo2020 show that executives treat investments within their own company in
isolation. In multi-business firms, the managers of each business unit often
make the investment decisions about individual projects. As such, they often do
not consider the scope of their decisions in the context of the entire company.
For instance, Nobel laureate Richard Thaler offered 25 division managers working
for the same firm a hypothetical investment that involves a 50% chance of
gaining $2 million for the company and a 50% chance of losing $1 million
[-@thaler1999]. Only three managers said they would accept the investment.
However, the CEO indicated that he would have clearly preferred managers to
accept all the investments. To each middle-manager, the choice represents a risk
of loss for their division and potentially their job, whereas for the CEO the
entire portfolio of choices represents a worthwhile risk.

This chapter investigates risky choice in the context of business project
investment internal to a company because this is a real-world context where
choice bracketing is important and currently under-appreciated [@lovallo2020].
The participants in these experiments were taken from a population that does not
have extensive managerial experience. However, in such a population a lack of
risk aggregation is most likely more common, and the variables used here are
readily applicable to the financial decisions that laypeople make. For instance,
one of the real-world applications of the choice bracketing literature has been
to use outcome distributions and increased time horizons to encourage investment
in high risk, but high EV, retirement funds [e.g., @benartzi1999]. Otherwise,
people typically prefer low risk, low EV, funds. Further, using laypeople
eliminates potential differences in prior experience with the management-based
decision-context. Upcoming research will focus on managers with context-specific
experience to investigate the effects of that experience.
