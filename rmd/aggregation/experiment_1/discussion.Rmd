### Discussion {#discussion-aggregation-1}

Experiment 1 found evidence for most of the hypotheses. Specifically, people
make more risky choices when considering those choices jointly on the same page,
compared to on separate pages; and when they know how many choices were in the
set. Further, the results show an interaction between project similarity and
presentation, as well as tentative evidence that people are less risk averse
when risky choices are aggregated for them. Exploratory analyses showed that
participants' risk aversion seemed to decrease as they proceeded through the
trials, but only when participants were aware of the number of projects.

#### Presentation effect

The presentation effect may be a result of one of two mechanisms. A mathematical
aggregation explanation would mean that participants are combining the gambles
into a mental representation of the probability distribution and then deciding
based on the attractiveness of that distribution. A joint presentation of
choices would facilitate this combination. On the other hand, people may also be
using a sort of "naive" aggregation process when they are encouraged to group
their choices together. A naive aggregation explanation would suggest that
participants in the joint condition are simply more likely to realise that a few
big wins could offset a few losses. Participants could have been encouraged by
the joint display to consider the set of projects together. This could then lead
to the conclusion that investing in a higher number of gambles might mean that
the gains of some projects will pay off the losses of the other projects.

#### Awareness effect

Experiment 1 found an awareness effect such that participants that viewed the
projects separately were more likely to invest in the projects as the trials
went on, regardless of the actual gambles. Having an awareness of the total
number of projects in the set could increase the likelihood that participants
would naively aggregate. Specifically, knowing the number of total projects
might increase the salience of the idea that the gains of some projects will
offset the losses of others, because it reinforces a focus on the entire set.
Another possibility is that participants had a certain aspiration level
[@lopes1996] that they were attempting to reach. This might mean that they
invested more as the task proceeded after realising that the gambles were not
becoming significantly more favourable. @barron2003 [p. 219] specifically did
not tell participants about the number of gambles they would experience to
"avoid an 'end of task' effect (e.g. a change in risk attitude)". @barron2003
provided participants with feedback, but this should not be necessary for an
aspiration level explanation since participants only need to be aware of the
potential for certain gains.

This result may also be due to a Gambler's fallacy effect or the law of small
numbers. This effect is characterised by people's expectation of a pattern to
follow the underlying distribution of the function that generates each
component. For instance, someone observing the results of a coin flip that look
like HTTHTTTT might anticipate that the likelihood of "heads" is higher than
that of a "tails", despite the actual likelihood being 50% for either. This
effect occurs in sequential decision-making, so may be relevant for the
repeated-play decisions in Experiment 1. @barron2010 found that the gambler's
fallacy (in a roulette prediction task) emerges when information about past
outcomes was displayed sequentially, but not when it is displayed all at once.
@haisley2008 found evidence for the gambler's fallacy with a repeated-play
gamble paradigm. As such, it is possible that an effect such as the Gambler's
fallacy can explain the effect of the awareness manipulation. That is,
participants may have thought that after a few gambles that they considered
risky, the last ones were more likely to materialise. Further, this would be
more likely to occur for those that knew the total number of projects, because
they knew when the sequence was approaching its end.

#### Similarity effect {#similarity-discussion-aggregation-1}

Experiment 1 did not find a main effect of similarity in the individual choice
data as predicted in Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:similarity-aggregation-1). Instead,
choice similarity interacted with the presentation condition. This interaction
is harder to explain since it was not hypothesised. In fact, the results seem to
suggest the opposite to what was originally expected. Initially, it was
predicted that people would be less risk averse in the high similarity
condition, due to the better ability to consider the isolated projects as a
grouped set. Similarity was through to act as a broad bracket, and therefore
increase aggregation. That is, it was expected that seeing a set of similar
projects would help participants aggregate risk when seeing them separately,
more than when projects are dissimilar. Instead, project acceptance was actually
numerically higher in the low than in the high similarity condition
(`r results_aggregation_1$highseparate_lowseparate`) when projects were
presented separately, averaging over awareness conditions.

There was no significant difference between similarity conditions regardless of
presentation condition. However, allocations were significantly higher in the
joint presentation condition than in the separate condition for both high and
low similarity. The interaction seems to have been found due to the larger
difference in the high similarity condition. Perhaps the ability to aggregate
risk when projects are presented together is more made more salient when
projects are similar.

Specifically, the interaction seems to be driven by the separate high similarity
condition being lower, rather than by the joint high similarity being higher, as
would have been expected. As such, participants could have been engaged in a
naive *diversification*, rather than a naive aggregation. In "true"
diversification, people would choose a set of projects that are partially (and
ideally negatively) correlated, as per @markowitz1952. However, in reality
people that intend to diversify only seem diversify naively, meaning that they
neglect co-variation when diversifying [e.g., @hedesstrom2006]. Instead, they
only seem to be looking for variety, rather than diversification in the strict
sense. This *diversification bias* is also seen in product choices [@read1995].

In Experiment 1, participants may have considered the high similarity condition
as a sign that the set of projects may not be sufficiently "diversified".
However, this explanation would also predict the joint presentation condition to
be lower in the high similarity condition. So, perhaps when in the separate
condition, participants were constantly thinking that they might be getting a
different project in the next display, so rejected more projects because of the
lack of diversification, but not realising that they would not be getting any
other type of project. Those in the joint presentation, on the other hand, were
able to see all ten projects, so already knew that there were no other projects
in the set, and so were less likely to reject projects on the basis of the hope
for different projects in the future.

#### Limitations

This experiment had two major limitations. First, proper counterbalancing was
not used in the high alignment project domain, nor in the order of the
within-subjects manipulation of presentation. As such, it is unclear what role
these elements played in the results, especially in the presentation condition,
in which participants always saw the separate condition first. Second, as
mentioned [above](#outcome-distribution-materials-aggregation-1), there was a
mistake in the generation of the gamble values that meant that the individual
gambles did not correspond with the distribution that participants saw. Both of
these limitations were addressed in Experiment [2](#aggregation-2).
