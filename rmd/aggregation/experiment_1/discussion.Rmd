### Discussion {#discussion-aggregation-1}

I found evidence for most of the Experiment 1 hypotheses. Specifically, I found
that people make more risky choices when considering those choices jointly on
the same page, compared to on separate pages; and when they know how many
choices were in the set. Further, I found an interaction between project
similarity and presentation, and found tentative evidence that people are less
risk averse when risky choices are aggregated for them. Exploratory analyses
showed that participants' risk aversion seemed to decrease as they proceeded
through the trials, but only when participants were aware of the number of
projects.

#### Presentation effect

The presentation effect may be a result of one of two mechanisms. A mathematical
aggregation explanation would mean that participants are combining the gambles
into a mental representation of the probability distribution and then deciding
based on the attractiveness of that distribution. A joint presentation of
choices would facilitate this combination. On the other hand, people may also be
using a sort of "naive" aggregation process when they are encouraged to group
their choices together. A naive aggregation explanation would suggest that
participants in the joint condition are simply more likely to realise that a few
big wins could offset a few losses. It may be the case that participants were
encouraged by the joint display to consider the set of projects together, and
perhaps conclude that ultimately investing in a higher number of gambles is
potentially valuable due to the possibility that one project might pay off the
projects that showed losses.

#### Awareness effect

I found an awareness effect such that participants that viewed the projects
separately, were more likely to invest in the projects as the trials went on,
regardless of the actual gambles. It might be the case that having an awareness
of the total number of projects in the set would increase the likelihood that
participants would naively aggregate. Specifically, knowing the number of total
projects might make the idea that the gains of some projects will offset the
losses of others will be more salient, because it reinforces a focus on the
entire set. Another possibility is that participants had a certain aspiration
level [@lopes1996] that they were attempting to reach. @barron2003 [p. 219]
specifically did not tell participants about the number of gambles they would
experience to "avoid an 'end of task' effect (e.g. a change in risk attitude)".
@barron2003 provided participants with feedback, but this should not be
necessary for an aspiration level explanation since participants only need to be
aware of the potential for certain gains.

Otherwise, this result may also be due to the Gambler's fallacy/law of small
numbers. This effect is characterised by people's expectation of a pattern to
follow the underlying distribution of the function that generates each
component. For instance, someone observing the results of a coin flip that look
like HTTHTTTT might anticipate that the likelihood of "heads" is higher than
that of a "tails", despite the actual likelihood being 50% for either. This
effect occurs in sequential decision-making, so may be relevant for the
repeated-play decisions in Experiment 1. @barron2010 found that the gambler's
fallacy (in a roulette prediction task) emerges when information about past
outcomes was displayed sequentially, but not when it is displayed all at once.
@haisley2008 found evidence for the gambler's fallacy with a repeated-play
gamble paradigm. As such, it is possible that a Gambler's fallacy-type effect
can explain the effect of the awareness manipulation. That is, participants may
have thought that after a few gambles that they considered risky, the last ones
were more likely to materialise. Further, this would be more likely to occur for
those that knew the total number of projects, because they knew when the
sequence was approaching its end.

#### Similarity effect {#similarity-discussion-aggregation-1}

I did not find a main effect of similarity in the individual choice data as
predicted in HypothesisÂ \@ref(hyp:similarity-aggregation-1). I found that
choice similarity interacted with the presentation condition. This interaction
is harder to explain since I did not originally hypothesise it. In fact, the
results seem to suggest the opposite to what was originally expected. Initially,
I predicted that people would be less risk averse in the high similarity
condition, due to the better ability to consider the isolated projects as a set.
I thought that more similarity would act as a broad bracket, and therefore
increase aggregation. That is, I would have expected that seeing a set of
similar projects would help participants aggregate risk when seeing them
separately, more than when projects are dissimilar. Instead, project acceptance
was actually numerically (but not statistically) higher in the low than in the
high similarity condition when projects were presented separately, averaging
over awareness conditions.

There was no significant difference between similarity conditions regardless of
presentation condition. However, joint presentation condition allocated
significantly more than those in the separate condition for both high and low
similarity. The interaction seems to have been found due to this difference
being larger in the high similarity condition. As such, the presentation effect
can be interpreted as having benefited from a joint presentation more when
projects were all from the same industry than when they were from different
industries. Perhaps the ability to aggregate risk when projects are presented
together is more made more salient when projects are similar.

Specifically, the interaction seems to be driven by the separate high similarity
condition being lower, rather than by the joint high similarity being higher, as
would have been expected. As such, it may be the case that participants were
engaging in a naive *diversification*, rather than a naive aggregation. In
"true" diversification, people would choose a set of projects that are partially
(and ideally negatively) correlated, as per @markowitz1952. However, in reality
to the extent that people diversify, they seem to only diversify naively,
meaning that they neglect co-variation when diversifying [e.g.,
@hedesstrom2006]. That is, they could be said to be looking for variety, rather
than diversification in the strict sense. This "diversification bias" is also
seen in product choices [@read1995].

In Experiment 1, participants may have considered the high similarity condition
a sign that the set of projects may not be sufficiently "diversified". However,
this explanation would also predict the joint presentation condition to be lower
in the high similarity condition. So, it might be the case that those in the
separate condition were constantly thinking that they might be getting a
different project in the next display, so rejected more projects because of the
lack of diversification, but not realising that they would not be getting any
other type of project. Those in the joint presentation, on the other hand, were
able to see all ten projects, so would already known that there were no other
projects in the set, and so were less likely to reject projects on the basis of
the hope for different projects in the future.

#### Limitations

This experiment had two major limitations. First, proper counterbalancing was
not used in project domains, nor in the order of the within-subjects
manipulation of presentation. As such, it is unclear what role these elements
played in the results, especially in the presentation condition, in which
participants always saw the separate condition first. Second, as mentioned
[above](#outcome-distribution-materials-aggregation-1), there was a mistake in the
generation of the gamble values that meant that the individual gambles did not
correspond with the distribution that participants saw. Experiment 2 replicated
the effects from this experiment in the high similarity condition, so addressed
the second issue. Experiment 2 addressed the counterbalancing issue by adding
more project domains.
