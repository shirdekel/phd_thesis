In Experiment 1, I investigated the effect of three choice bracketing
manipulations on risky choice in hypothetical resource allocation scenarios.
Previous research had low ecological validity because of the use of multi-play
paradigms or feedback. In this experiment, the risky choice task was a
description-based repeated-play paradigm, meaning that participants had to make
a choice about whether to accept a number of different hypothetical investments,
but were not provided with feedback about their choices. I manipulated the
similarity of the choices, whether they were presented together or separately,
and whether participants were aware of the number of choices that they would be
making.

The values and probabilities of the gambles were set up such that each
individual gamble, as well as the aggregation of all the gambles, would be
attractive to a rational agent interested in maximising EV. As such, the key
dependent measure was the proportion of risky choices participants accept.

Previous research suggests that people will exhibit more risky choice when
explicitly told to bracket their choices [@sokolhessner2009; @sokolhessner2012],
when choices are presented jointly [e.g., @moher2010; @hsee1999], and when
choices are similar [e.g., @dekay2005; @markman1995]. Therefore, I tested the
following hypotheses:

``` {hypothesis, awareness-aggregation-1, echo = TRUE}
Participants that know how many projects to expect will make more risky choices
than participants that are unaware.
```

``` {hypothesis, presentation-aggregation-1, echo = TRUE}
Participants will make more risky choices when seeing projects jointly than when
seeing them separately.
```

``` {hypothesis, similarity-aggregation-1, echo = TRUE}
Participants that see projects from the same industry will make more risky
choices than participants that see projects from different industries.
```
