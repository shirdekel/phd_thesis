\noindent \textbf{Naviation}

There are links throughout the PDF document, identified by
\textcolor{mylinkcolor}{dark blue} text. Clicking on these will take you to the
relevant hypothesis, footnote, citation, figure, table, section, or URL. If you
are using Preview (on a Mac) then you can subsequently return back to where you
clicked on the link by pressing the key combination \keys{\cmd + [} (the command
key with the left square bracket). In Adobe Acrobat the key combination is
\keys{\cmd + \arrowkeyleft} (the command key with the left arrow key) for Mac
and \keys{\Altwin + \arrowkeyleft} (the Alt key with the left arrow key) for
Windows.
