\noindent \textbf{Naviating the document on a computer}

There are links throughout the PDF document that facilitate navigation between
cross-references. For most PDF viewers these are identified by
\textcolor{mylinkcolor}{dark blue} text. Otherwise, if you are using Adobe
Acrobat you may instead have to look for the cursor to turn into a hand pointer
(\faHandPointer[regular]). Clicking on these links will take you to the relevant
hypothesis (e.g., Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:awareness-aggregation-1)),
footnote,[^example] citation [e.g., @samuelson1963], figure (e.g.,
Figure \@ref(fig:prospect-theory)), table (e.g.,
Table \@ref(tab:condition-allocation-aggregation-1)), or section (e.g.,
Chapter \@ref(introduction)) that they reference.

[^example]: Example of a footnote.

If you are using Preview (on a Mac) then you can subsequently return back to
where you clicked on the link by pressing the key combination \keys{\cmd + [}
(the command key with the left square bracket). In Adobe Acrobat the key
combination is \keys{\cmd + \arrowkeyleft} (the command key with the left arrow
key) for Mac and \keys{\Altwin + \arrowkeyleft} (the Alt key with the left arrow
key) for Windows.

The thesis can also be navigated by section using the linked page numbers in the
Table of Contents below. To display the Table of Contents as a sidebar in
Preview go to \menu{View > Table of Contents} and then click \menu{Show} at the
top right of the sidebar. Alternatively, you can use the key combination
\keys{\Altmac + \cmd + 3} (the option and command keys with the number 3). To
display the Table of Contents as a sidebar in Adobe Acrobat go to \menu{View >
Show/Hide > Navigation panes > Bookmarks}.

\noindent \textbf{Appendices}

Many experiments were conducted throughout the development of this thesis.
Further, each experiment included multiple measures and analyses, and not all of
these were directly relevant for the thesis. Therefore, the main body of the
text contains the content that was deemed most important, while three appendices
contained the rest of the content. These appendices contain reports of
supplementary experiments, experimental materials, additional measures, data
simulations, power analyses, and extra explanatory material. The appendices are
organised by the relevant empirical chapter:
Appendix \@ref(aggregation-appendix) for Chapter \@ref(aggregation),
Appendix \@ref(alignment-appendix) for Chapter \@ref(alignment), and
Appendix \@ref(anecdotes-appendix) for Chapter \@ref(anecdotes).

\noindent \textbf{Reproducibility}

The thesis was compiled using `rmarkdown` [@xie2018] with `bookdown` [@xie2016].
`renv` [@ushey2021] was used to create reproducible environments and `targets`
[@landau2021] was used to create a reproducible pipeline. Typesetting was done
with \LaTeX, based on the `oxforddown` template [@lyngs2019]. All the components
required to reproduce this document can be found at the GitHub repository:
