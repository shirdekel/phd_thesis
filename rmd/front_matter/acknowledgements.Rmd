I am immensely grateful for my supervisors Dr Micah Goldwater, Professor Dan
Lovallo, and Dr Bruce Burns. Micah was there for me from the initial struggles
for an idea, to the stress of unexpected findings, to the last-minute questions
about wording minutiae. Thank you for the spontaneous hallway conversations and
for prioritising me when it was necessary. Dan's work and thought inspired much
of the thesis experiments. Thank you for passing on valuable insights from your
mentors, for challenging me, and for opening so many doors. Bruce's incisive
feedback gave me confidence in the experiment development and subsequent
writing. Thank you for the attention to detail and for our extended
conversations.

My family were critical to the thesis even before its inception. My parents were
always a model for critical and creative thought and encouraged my curiosity.
In a way, the PhD really began with my backyard inventions and experiments. I am
also grateful for my sisters for our Friday nights jams and for allowing me to
always have someone I can strive to impress.

Thank you to everyone else who supported me. To Rachel, for the love,
understanding, calls, runs, activities, and donut deliveries. To Nicky, Jacob,
and Mich for being my second family throughout *our* thesis. To Yoav and Josh
for being my spiritual housemates and for tolerating their measly monthly quota.
And to those who made an effort to read a portion of the thesis and contributed
helpful insights (and to David for actually doing so).

Two years ago, my coding knowledge consisted of what I learnt at the *HTML
Basics* class that I took when I was nine years old. Since then, I wrote the
text of my thesis in Emacs and developed almost everything else as reproducible
code. This would have not been possible without the support of the online `R`
community on GitHub, Stack Exchange, and Twitter.

Chapters \@ref(alignment), \@ref(interstitial-2), and \@ref(anecdotes) of this
thesis were edited by Elite Editing, and editorial intervention was restricted
to Standards D and E of the Australian Standards for Editing Practice.

Thank you all.
