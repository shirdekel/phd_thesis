# Anecdote similarity moderates anecdotal bias in resource allocation {#anecdotes}

## Introduction

A good story is often more persuasive than data. While usually harmless in daily
settings, poor judgement due to a bias towards anecdotal evidence can lead to
larger-scale negative consequences. Perhaps the most prominent example of such
an error in judgement is belief that a vaccine causes a certain disorder based
on isolated stories, despite contradictory scientific evidence. An analogous
error exists in settings such as managerial decision-making. In business,
managers use analogies, usually called *case studies*, as a part of strategic
decision-making. Case studies are examples of previous situations that are
considered similar by the decision-maker and are used to draw inferences about a
target problem. When comparing such examples with aggregated data these are
called anecdotes.

Many businesses use case studies to inform their decisions, but often struggle
to use them successfully [@gavetti2005a]. This is likely because of the high
salience of companies that have ended up either very successful or very
unsuccessful. That is, people are often uninterested in average outcomes, but
are captivated by both positive or negative extreme outcomes. This has two
related impacts: increased salience of an anecdote may increase its influence
above statistical data and may shift attention away from structural similarities
in favour of more surface similarities. The extent to which statistical data is
consulted and the decision-maker's judgement of the anecdote's similarity are
two issues that may explain the unsuccessful use of case studies.

The first consideration when using a case study is its merit relative to
available aggregated statistical data. That is, if the case study is a single
data point in a set of other relevant cases, then using the statistical
properties of the larger sample is more inferentially informative than using a
single case from within the sample. Research has shown that people sometimes
prefer anecdotal evidence over statistical data [e.g., @reinard1988; @shen2015;
@jaramillo2019].

However, if this larger sample is not available (or is ignored), then the second
consideration when using a case study is the extent of its similarity to the
target problem. Research on similarity distinguishes between surface and
relational similarity [@gentner1983]; the consensus of this research is that the
more conceptual structures two cases share, the more useful they are in
decision-making [@markman1995; @lassaline1996]. As such, case studies that are
similar to a target problem on a merely surface level are less useful than those
that are related by shared conceptual structure.

Previous research has considered the role of similarity and analogical reasoning
in business-related decision-making [@gavetti2005], but it is unclear to what
extent the similarity of a anecdote to the target will affect the strength of
the anecdotal bias.

### Anecdotal bias

Anecdotal bias is the finding that anecdotal evidence influences people's
beliefs more than statistical evidence. Journalists are well aware of the power
of anecdotes. For example, an analysis of approximately 29,000 New York Times
editorials showing a reliance on anecdotes to drive arguments [@alkhatib2017].
While some research concluded that statistics are more persuasive than anecdotes
[e.g., @allen1997; @hornikx2005; @hoeken2001] and others were equivocal
[@winterbottom2008], a number of studies have found evidence for anecdotal bias
[e.g., @reinard1988; @shen2015; @jaramillo2019; @ratcliff2020; @reinhart2006].
@zebregs2015 suggested that this disparity in findings might be due to
statistics having an effect on beliefs and attitudes, and anecdotes affecting
intention. A more recent meta-analysis of 61 studies showed that overall people
find statistical evidence more persuasive than anecdotal evidence
[@freling2020]. However, even if statistical evidence is overall more persuasive
across studies, anecdotes than add no additional information to co-presented
statistics still influence judgement [@jaramillo2019]. Further, the
meta-analysis found that people tend to prefer anecdotal evidence over
statistical data when the stakes are more emotional, medical, or relevant to the
decision-maker. In business, the decisions are clearly relevant to the
decision-maker.

### Anecdotal bias in business

It is important to investigate anecdotal bias in business because of the
implications this might have on managers' use of case studies. There are many
cases of managers successfully using analogies from anecdotal cases, but also of
failures to analogise properly [@gavetti2005; @gavetti2005a]. There is very
little research on anecdote bias in business, but the existing work finds clear
evidence of the effect. In fact, the recent meta-analysis by @freling2020 only
included the work in @wainberg2013 as one such paper. @wainberg2013 gave a
sample of managers and other professionals a choice between two audit firms that
was based on their audit deficiencies for various clients. The experiment was
designed in a way that the statistical evidence favoured one firm and the
anecdotal evidence favoured the other firm. Participants either viewed an
*anecdote only* condition in which they were shown examples of firm
deficiencies; an *anecdote + statistics* condition in which they were shown the
same as in the anecdote condition, but also the number of deficiencies and
clients (but they were not explicitly provided the proportions); a *statistics
only* condition in which the proportions and clients without deficiencies are
made explicit; an *anecdote + enhanced statistics* condition that added the
anecdotes to the statistics only condition; and an *anecdote + enhanced
statistics – judgment orientation* condition, which emphasised the importance of
proportions and keeping absolute numbers in their relevant context.

@wainberg2013 found equivalent proportions of participants choosing the firm
favoured by the statistical data by those viewing just the anecdotal information
and both the anecdotal information and the statistics. Further, participants
chose the statistically favoured firm less when seeing both types of information
than when seeing just statistics even when the underlying proportions were made
explicit (anecdote + enhanced statistics condition). This provided evidence of
anecdotal bias, as participants seemed to ignore the contradictory statistical
data. Further, having found no difference between the anecdote + statistics
condition and the anecdote only condition implies that the anecdotal bias effect
is "complete", because it shows that the statistics displayed played no role in
influencing choice. A "partial" effect would have been if the anecdote +
statistics condition had been chosen more than the anecdote only condition. This
would mean that statistics still played some role in influencing choice.
Highlighting relevant statistical features and providing some explanation of
statistical inference reduced this anecdotal bias.

@wainberg2018 conducted a similar study to @wainberg2013, but with a capital
budgeting task. Participants had to choose between purchasing three
production-line machines for a mid-sized company that prints circuit boards. The
statistical data was constructed such that Machine A was better than Machine B,
which was better than Machine C. Participants were either given just this
information, or were also provided with an anecdote. This anecdote was in the
form of an email correspondence from a colleague from another company that
recommended against Machine A (the best option). As in @wainberg2013,
participants were assigned to *anecdote + statistics* and *statistics only*
conditions. As well as these, in the *judgment orientation I & II* conditions,
participants were told to "think like a scientist" and either received a short
or long explanation of what this means (essentially explaining the importance of
statistical inference). @wainberg2018 found that including a contradictory
anecdote alongside the statistics (the anecdote + statistics condition) reduced
the proportion of choosing Machine A. This indicated evidence for anecdotal
bias. The addition of instructions that emphasise scientific thinking further
reduced this bias.

### Effect of similarity

The extent of one's reliance on an anecdote should arguably be moderated by its
similarity to the target problem. Previous work has discussed the importance of
weighting previous cases by their similarity to the present situation
[@gilboa1995; @lovallo2012]. For instance, on the one hand, an individual's
decision of whether to take a certain medical treatment should be informed more
by a large-scale aggregated study showing 99% efficacy than by a story of
someone getting sick as a side-effect of the treatment that they read on social
media. On the other hand, the individual might have reason to be concerned if
the person who got sick was the individual’s identical twin. The inference that
the individual may therefore also need to be cautious about the treatment arises
from a specific causal model based on the two cases' shared genetics.

There have been mixed results regarding the effect of similarity of anecdote on
the extent of anecdotal bias. @hoeken2009 [Study 3] found evidence for an effect
of similarity on anecdotal bias with laypeople for a variety of claims. As well
as manipulating whether participants received a claim supported by an anecdote
or statistical evidence, they manipulated whether the anecdotal evidence was
similar or dissimilar to the claim that it was supporting. They found that
similar anecdotes were more persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes. @hoeken2001
did not find evidence for an effect of similarity about a local government
proposal with a student sample. Similarly, @hornikx2018 considered the effect of
similarity on anecdote bias in local government policy decision-making. The
researchers did not find an effect of similarity, or an effect of anecdotes.
However, they measured persuasiveness and perhaps requiring to make more
concrete decisions will be a better test for a more real-life scenario.

Apart from the need to clarify the effect of similarity on the anecdotal bias
effect, it is important to clarify how such an effect might work. Research on
analogical reasoning has made the distinction between simple surface similarity
and deeper relational similarity [@gentner1983]. As mentioned above, one's use
of an anecdote should be moderated by the extent to which it is associated by an
underlying casual mechanism or mere surface similarity. Imagine a manager of a
multi-divisional company that is deciding how to allocate capital between an oil
well project and a technology project. Would hearing of a recent failed oil well
project at a different company influence the manager's allocation decision? If
so, would it influence the decision because of the fact that the anecdote and
one of the target projects are from the same industry (surface similarity)? Or
would the manager look to the underlying reason of why the anecdote failed and
first identify if this mechanism is relevant to the target oil project? The
experiments in this chapter investigate whether the anecdotal bias effect is due
to causal inductive reasoning or merely the association between the valence of
the anecdote and surface similarity with the target.

### Experiment summary

[Experiment 1](#anecdotes-1) investigated whether anecdotal bias in a resource
allocation paradigm was moderated by similarity of the anecdotes. Further, I
tested whether giving extra information about statistical thinking would
encourage participants to consider the statistics over the anecdote. Experiment
1 used a negative anecdote, as this has been shown to produce anecdotal bias in
both medical [@jaramillo2019] and business [@wainberg2018] decision-making.
However, @jaramillo2019 found less of a bias in positive anecdotes, and
@wainberg2018 did not consider these at all. Therefore, [Experiment
2](#anecdotes-2) attempted to replicate the effect of similarity on anecdotal
bias with a positive valence anecdote.
