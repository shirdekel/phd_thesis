# Anecdote similarity moderates anecdotal bias in capital allocation {#anecdotes}

## Introduction

A good story is often more persuasive than data. While usually harmless in daily
settings, poor judgement due to a bias towards anecdotal evidence can lead to
larger-scale negative consequences. Perhaps the most prominent example of such
an error in judgement is the belief that a vaccine causes a certain disorder
based on isolated stories, despite contradictory scientific evidence. An
analogous error exists in settings such as managerial decision-making. In
business, managers use analogies, usually called *case studies*, as a part of
strategic decision-making. Case studies are examples of previous situations that
are considered similar by the decision-maker and are used to draw inferences
about a target problem. When comparing such examples with aggregated data these
are called anecdotes.

Many businesses use case studies to inform their decisions, but often struggle
to use them successfully [@gavetti2005a]. This is likely because of the high
salience of companies that have ended up either very successful or very
unsuccessful. That is, people are often uninterested in average outcomes, but
are captivated by both positive and negative extreme outcomes. Increased
salience of an anecdote may increase its influence above useful statistical
data. Further, increased anecdote salience may also shift attention away from
structural similarities in favour of more surface similarities. Both of these
issues may explain unsuccessful use of case studies.

The first consideration when using a case study is its merit relative to
available aggregated statistical data. That is, if the case study is a single
data point in a set of other relevant cases, then using the statistical
properties of the larger sample is more inferentially informative than using a
single case from within the sample. Despite this, research has shown that people
can prefer anecdotal evidence over statistical data [e.g., @reinard1988;
@shen2015; @jaramillo2019; @freling2020].

However, if this larger sample is not available (or is ignored), then the second
consideration when using a case study is the extent of its similarity to the
target problem. Research on the psychology of similarity judgements
distinguishes between surface and relational similarity [@gentner1983]. The
consensus of this research is that the more conceptual structures two cases
share, the more useful they are in decision-making [@markman1995;
@lassaline1996]. As such, case studies that are similar to a target problem on a
merely surface level are less useful than those that are related by shared
conceptual structure.

Previous research has considered the role of similarity and analogical reasoning
in business-related decision-making [e.g., @gavetti2005]. Other work has
investigated the impact of anecdotes in capital allocation decisions, and
separately the impact of similarity on anecdotes (summarised below). However, it
is unclear to what extent an anecdote's similarity to the target problem will
affect the influence of anecdotes in capital allocation decisions. Further, it
is unclear whether people will be sensitive to information about the
distribution from which the anecdote was sampled.

### Anecdotal bias

Anecdotal bias is the finding that anecdotal evidence sometimes influences
people's beliefs more than statistical evidence. Journalists, for instance, are
well aware of the power of anecdotes. An analysis of approximately 29,000 New
York Times editorials showed a reliance on anecdotes to drive arguments
[@alkhatib2017]. While some research concluded that statistics are more
persuasive than anecdotes [e.g., @allen1997; @hornikx2005; @hoeken2001] and
others were equivocal [@winterbottom2008], a number of studies have found
evidence for anecdotal bias [e.g., @reinard1988; @shen2015; @jaramillo2019;
@ratcliff2020; @reinhart2006]. @zebregs2015 suggested that this disparity in
findings might be due to statistics having an effect on beliefs and attitudes,
and anecdotes affecting intention. A more recent meta-analysis of 61 studies
showed that overall people find statistical evidence more persuasive than
anecdotal evidence [@freling2020]. However, even if statistical evidence is
overall more persuasive across studies, anecdotes that add no additional
information to co-presented statistics still influence judgement
[@jaramillo2019]. Further, the meta-analysis found that people tend to prefer
anecdotal evidence over statistical data when the stakes are more emotional,
medical, or relevant to the decision-maker. In business, the decisions are
clearly relevant to the decision-maker.

### Anecdotal bias in business

It is important to investigate anecdotal bias in business because of the
implications this might have on managers' use of case studies. There are many
cases of managers successfully using analogies from anecdotal cases, but also of
failures to analogise properly [@gavetti2005; @gavetti2005a]. There is very
little research on anecdotal bias in business, but the existing work finds clear
evidence of the effect. In fact, the recent meta-analysis by @freling2020 only
included the work in @wainberg2013 as one such paper.

@wainberg2013 gave a sample of managers and other professionals a choice between
two audit firms, which varied in their audit deficiencies for various clients.
The experiment was designed in a way that the statistical evidence favoured one
firm and the anecdotal evidence favoured the other firm. Participants viewed one
of five conditions. In the *anecdote only* condition, they were shown examples
of firm deficiencies; whereas in the *anecdote & statistics* condition, they
were shown the same as in the anecdote condition, but also saw the number of
deficiencies and clients. However, participants were not explicitly provided the
proportions for these values. In the *statistics only* condition, the
proportions and clients without deficiencies were made explicit. The *anecdote &
enhanced statistics* condition added the anecdotes to the statistics only
condition. The *anecdote & enhanced statistics---judgment orientation* condition
emphasised the importance of proportions and keeping absolute numbers in their
relevant context.

@wainberg2013 found evidence for anecdotal bias. They measured the proportion of
participants choosing the firm favoured by the statistical data. Those that saw
only the anecdote chose this firm equivalently to those that saw both the
anecdote and the statistics. Further, participants chose this firm less when
seeing both types of information than when seeing just statistics, even when the
underlying proportions were made explicit (anecdote & enhanced statistics
condition). This provided evidence of anecdotal bias, as participants ignored
contradictory statistical data.

Finding no difference between the anecdote & statistics condition and the
anecdote only condition implies that the anecdotal bias effect is "complete".
That is, this shows that the statistics displayed did not play a role in
influencing choice. A "partial" effect would have been one in which the anecdote
& statistics condition had been chosen more than the anecdote only condition.
This would mean that statistics still played some role in influencing choice.

The other important finding in this work was that highlighting relevant
statistical features and providing some explanation of statistical inference
reduced the anecdotal bias. This is important because it suggests that potential
psychological biases can be reduced with a re-framing of the provided
information and an explanation of the relevant statistical concepts.

@wainberg2018 conducted a similar study to @wainberg2013, but with a capital
budgeting task, as opposed to a binary choice. Participants had to choose
between purchasing three production-line machines for a mid-sized company that
prints circuit boards. The provided statistical data suggested that Machine A
was better than Machine B, which was better than Machine C. Participants were
either given only this information, or were also provided with an anecdote. This
anecdote was in the form of an email correspondence from a colleague from
another company that recommended against Machine A (the best option). As in
@wainberg2013, participants were assigned to *anecdote & statistics* and
*statistics only* conditions. In the *judgment orientation I* and *judgment
orientation II* conditions, participants were told to "think like a scientist"
and either received an explanation of what this means, which was either short or
a long, respectively. These explanations emphasised the importance of
statistical inference.

@wainberg2018 found evidence for anecdotal bias. Including a contradictory
anecdote alongside statistical evidence (the anecdote & statistics condition)
reduced the proportion of choosing Machine A. They also found that the addition
of instructions that emphasised scientific thinking reduced this bias. Unlike
@wainberg2013, @wainberg2018 could not determine whether this was a complete or
partial anecdotal bias because they did not use an anecdote only condition.
Further, neither work considered the effect of the similarity of the content of
the anecdote to the target problem.

### Effect of similarity {#effect-of-similarity}

The extent of one's reliance on an anecdote should arguably be moderated by its
similarity to the target problem. Previous work has discussed the importance of
weighting previous cases by their similarity to the present situation
[@gilboa1995; @lovallo2012]. For instance, consider a medical treatment that
with contradictory statistical and anecdotal evidence. A large-scale aggregated
study found 99% efficacy of the treatment, while an individual reports on social
media that they became sick as a side-effect of the treatment. On the one hand,
an individual's decision of whether to use the treatment should be informed more
by the aggregated data than by the anecdote. On the other hand, the individual
might have reason to be concerned if the person who became sick was the
individual’s identical twin. The inference that the individual may therefore
also need to be cautious about the treatment arises from a specific causal model
based on the two cases' shared genetics.

There have been mixed results regarding the effect of anecdote similarity on the
extent of anecdotal bias. @hoeken2009 [Study 3] found evidence for an effect of
similarity on anecdotal bias with laypeople for a variety of claims. As well as
manipulating whether participants received a claim supported by an anecdote or
statistical evidence, they manipulated whether the anecdotal evidence was
similar or dissimilar to the claim that it was supporting. They found that
similar anecdotes were more persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes. @hoeken2001
did not find evidence for an effect of similarity about a local government
proposal with a student sample. Similarly, @hornikx2018 considered the effect of
similarity on anecdotal bias in local government policy decision-making. The
researchers did not find an effect of similarity, or an effect of anecdotes.
However, they measured persuasiveness and perhaps requiring to make more
concrete decisions will be a better test for a more real-life scenario.

Apart from the need to clarify the effect of similarity on the anecdotal bias
effect, it is important to clarify how such an effect might work. Research on
analogical reasoning has made the distinction between simple surface similarity
and deeper relational similarity [@gentner1983]. As mentioned above, one's use
of an anecdote should be moderated by the extent to which it is associated by an
underlying casual mechanism or mere surface similarity. Imagine a manager of a
multi-divisional company that is deciding how to allocate capital between an oil
well project and a technology project. Would hearing of a recent failed oil well
project at a different company influence the manager's allocation decision? If
so, would it influence the decision because of the fact that the anecdote and
one of the target projects are from the same industry (surface similarity)? Or
would the manager look to the underlying reason of why the anecdote failed and
first identify if this mechanism is relevant to the target oil project
(relational similarity)? The experiments in this chapter investigate whether the
anecdotal bias effect is due to causal inductive reasoning or merely the
association between the valence of the anecdote and surface similarity with the
target.

### Experiment summary

Experiment 1 investigated whether anecdotal bias in a capital allocation
paradigm is moderated by similarity of the anecdotes. Further, it tested whether
giving extra information about statistical thinking would encourage participants
to consider the statistics over the anecdote. Experiment 1 used a negative
anecdote, which is an example of an unsuccessful case. This kind of anecdote has
been shown to produce anecdotal bias in both medical [@jaramillo2019] and
business [@wainberg2018] decision-making. However, @jaramillo2019 found less of
a bias in positive anecdotes, which are examples of successful cases, and
@wainberg2018 did not consider these at all. Therefore, Experiment 2 attempted
to replicate the effect of similarity on anecdotal bias with a positive valence
anecdote. Further, Experiment 2 provided participants with information about the
sample distribution of the anecdote, whereas Experiment 1 did not. This allowed
for an informal test of whether people are sensitive to such information.
