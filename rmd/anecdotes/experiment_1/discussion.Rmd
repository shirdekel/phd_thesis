### Discussion

Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1) was supported.
Participants allocated less resources when seeing both the anecdote and
statistics than when just seeing statistics. However, this effect was moderated
by similarity since it was seen in the high similarity condition, but not in the
low similarity condition. This shows that while anecdotal bias exists when the
anecdote is similar, participants are not influenced when the causal mechanisms
do not match. Contrary to Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1), despite
being influenced by the anecdote, participants still made some use of the
statistics. This is different from @wainberg2013, who found no difference
between an anecdote only and an anecdote & statistics condition, indicating a
complete effect of anecdotal bias.
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1) was also not supported, as
the added enhanced statistical language used to encourage participants to use
the statistical information did not contribute to reducing participants'
reliance on anecdotes.

Experiment 1 was limited because it only considered an anecdote with a
*negative* valence. That is, the case study was of a project that failed.
However, in real life these case studies are often ones with *positive* valence.
That is, a story of a successful company. In fact, in business, the anecdotes
that are used might be more likely to be positive, because of survivorship bias.
@jaramillo2019 found an anecdotal bias effect in negative anecdotes, but not in
positive anecdotes. This may be because the stimuli consisted of medical
decisions and in this domain a loss of health may be felt stronger than an
equivalent gain of health. Experiment 2 added a condition with a positive
anecdote, in order to investigate whether anecdote valence will impact the
anecdotal bias effect.

It was unclear if the effects found in Experiment 1 were related to
participants' perceptions of the type of sampling used in selecting the
anecdotes. The instructions in Experiment 1 do not explain how the anecdote
displayed to participants was chosen. Whether sampling is intentional or random
has been shown to affect people's decision-making [e.g., @hayes2019]. In the
case of the current experiments, the sampling assumption changes the extent to
which it is rational to use the anecdote or not. It may be considered rational
to choose the anecdote over the aggregated data if 1. the anecdote was not
sampled randomly from the pool of anecdotes, and 2. the anecdote is more similar
to the target project than any of the other anecdotes in the pool in relevant
ways. That is, if the anecdote was chosen because of its high relevance to the
target project, it would be irrational to ignore it. In Experiment 1 it was
unclear whether participants might have held these beliefs. In order to control
for these assumptions, in Experiment 2 text was added to the instructions that
clarified that the anecdote 1. was sampled randomly from the pool of anecdotes,
and 2. is not significantly more similar to the target project than any of the
other anecdotes in the pool.
