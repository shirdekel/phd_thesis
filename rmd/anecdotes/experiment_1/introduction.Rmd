In Experiment 1 I investigated the effects of similarity and anecdotal bias on
resource allocation. I asked participants to allocate a hypothetical budget
between two business projects. I also presented participants with a case study
that was either similar or dissimilar to the target project (but still from the
same industry). Further, participants were allocated to the same conditions as
in @wainberg2018, except that of the two judgement orientation conditions, I
only used the *judgment orientation II* condition. Further, I included an
anecdote only condition. For the conditions with statistical evidence,
participants also saw aggregated information about the success of similar
projects in the form of Net Present Value (NPV) and a reliability measure. As in
@wainberg2018, one project (Project A) was clearly better than the other
(Project B) when considering the statistical data, but the anecdotal evidence
suggested the opposite.

Previous research found that in resource allocation scenarios, people are more
persuaded by negative anecdotes than by positive statistical data
[@wainberg2018]. While other work has shown that similar anecdotes are more
persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes [@hoeken2009\; Study 3], it is unclear how
similarity changes the anecdotal bias effect. As such, my main question is
whether anecdotal bias will be greater when the anecdote is similar, compared to
when it is dissimilar. Evidence of anecdotal bias is given when a statistics
only condition is different to an anecdote + statistics condition. Therefore, I
tested the following hypothesis:

``` {hypothesis, anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1, name = "Anecdotal bias is moderated by the similarity of negative anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
The target project is supported by the statistics, but is inconsistent with the
anecdotes, thus: Allocations to the target project will be higher when only the
statistics are presented and when the statistics are accompanied by a low
similarity anecdote, in comparison to when the statistics are accompanied by a
high similarity anecdote. In addition, allocations are predicted to not be
affected by the low similarity anecdote at all. That is, the statistics only
condition should not differ from the low similarity anecdote + statistics
condition.
```

I predicted that that the anecdotal bias effect will be complete, as in
@wainberg2013, such that the participants presented with the high similarity
anecdote along with the statistics will not use any statistical information.
Testing the high similarity condition will allow for an equivalent test to
@wainberg2013. Therefore, I tested the following hypothesis:

``` {hypothesis, statistics-anecdotes-1, name = "Effect of statistics for negative anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
Participants will allocate resources equivalently to the target project when in
the high similarity anecdote + statistics condition and when in the high
similarity anecdote only condition without enhancing the statisics explanation.
```

Participants with additional information explaining the importance of
"scientific thinking" and statistical data may be less affected by anecdotes, as
in the *judgment orientation II* condition in @wainberg2018, here called “the
enhanced statistics condition.” Here, I test whether this effect protecting
against anecdotal bias would replicate in a resource allocation scenario.
Therefore, I tested the following hypothesis:

``` {hypothesis, enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1, name = "Effect of enhanced statistics for negative anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
Participants will allocate more resources to the target project when in the high
similarity anecdote + enhanced statistics condition than when in the high
similarity anecdote + statistics condition.
