Experiment 1 investigated the effects of similarity and anecdotal bias on
capital allocation. Participants were asked to allocate a hypothetical budget
between two business projects. They also saw a case study that was either
similar or dissimilar to the target project (but still from the same industry).
Further, participants were allocated to the same conditions as in @wainberg2018,
except that of the two judgement orientation conditions, only the *judgment
orientation II* condition was used. Further, an anecdote only condition was
used. For the conditions with statistical evidence, participants also saw
aggregated information about the success of similar projects in the form of Net
Present Value (NPV) as well as a reliability measure. One project was clearly
better than the other when considering the statistical data, but the anecdotal
evidence suggested the opposite.

Previous research found that people are more persuaded by negative anecdotes
than by positive statistical data in capital allocation scenarios
[@wainberg2018]. While other work has shown that similar anecdotes are more
persuasive than dissimilar anecdotes [@hoeken2009\; Study 3], it is unclear how
similarity changes the anecdotal bias effect. As such, the main question is
whether anecdotal bias will be greater when the anecdote is similar, compared to
when it is dissimilar. The target project is supported by the statistics, but is
inconsistent with the anecdotes. Further, Experiment 1 only used negative
anecdotes. So, evidence of anecdotal bias is given when a statistics only
condition is higher than an anecdote & statistics condition. Therefore,
Experiment 1 tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1, name = "Anecdotal bias is moderated by the similarity of negative anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
Allocations to the target project will be higher when only the statistics are
presented and when the statistics are accompanied by a low similarity anecdote,
in comparison to when the statistics are accompanied by a high similarity
anecdote. In addition, allocations are predicted to not be affected by the low
similarity anecdote at all. That is, the statistics only condition should not
differ from the low similarity anecdote & statistics condition.
```

Experiment 1 predicted that that the anecdotal bias effect will be complete, as
in @wainberg2013. Specifically, the participants presented with the high
similarity anecdote along with the statistics will not use any statistical
information. Testing the high similarity condition will allow for an equivalent
test to @wainberg2013. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, statistics-anecdotes-1, name = "Effect of statistics for negative anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
Participants will allocate capital equivalently to the target project when in
the high similarity anecdote & statistics condition and when in the high
similarity anecdote only condition without enhancing the statistics explanation.
```

Participants with additional information explaining the importance of
"scientific thinking" and statistical data may be less affected by anecdotes, as
in the *judgment orientation II* condition in @wainberg2018, here called the
"enhanced statistics condition." Here, Experiment 1 tests whether this effect
protecting against anecdotal bias would replicate in a capital allocation
scenario. Therefore, Experiment 1 tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, enhanced-statistics-anecdotes-1, name = "Effect of enhanced statistics for negative anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
Participants will allocate more capital to the target project when in the high
similarity anecdote & enhanced statistics condition than when in the high
similarity anecdote & statistics condition.
