Experiment 1 replicated the anecdotal bias effect. That is, people used an
anecdote more when presented with conflicting statistics than with anecdote
alone and less than with statistics alone. However, anecdote similarity
moderated this effect, such that anecdotal bias was stronger when the anecdote
was similar to the current task, than when it was dissimilar. Experiment 1 only
used a negative anecdote because previous research found anecdotal bias for
negative, but not for positive anecdotes [@jaramillo2019]. However,
@jaramillo2019 considered medical decision-making, so this effect of anecdote
valence may be different in a business context. In the study, the positive
anecdote involved a treatment that led to a reduction in symptoms and the
negative anecdote involved symptoms persisting. This framing might mean
participants represented the positive anecdote as a return to a reference point
and the negative anecdote as a continuation of a reduction in well-being
relative to the reference point. In business, however, both successful and
failed business projects represents a deviation from a reference point. To test
this difference further, Experiment 2 added an anecdote valence manipulation

In order to increase the experiment's power, anecdote valence and anecdote
similarity were manipulated within-subjects. Further, Experiment 2 did not
include the anecdote & enhanced statistics manipulation, because Experiment 1
did not find evidence for its effect. All participants saw the statistics only
condition, as it did not contain an anecdote, and therefore did not need to be
manipulated between-subjects. Each participant therefore saw five displays, with
one statistics only condition; and four displays for either the anecdote only
condition, or the anecdote & statistics condition. These four anecdote displays
consisted of the similarity (low and high) $\times$ valence (negative and
positive) conditions.

Experiment 1 did not clarify certain assumptions about the way the displayed
anecdote was sampled from the pool of anecdotes. In Experiment 2, participants
were told that the anecdote was sampled randomly and that it was not uniquely
similar to the target project. This should lead to a reliance on the statistical
evidence, regardless of the anecdote's similarity. However, since people often
struggle to use statistical concepts presented descriptively, it was expected
that the effects of Experiment 1 will replicate in the negative valence
condition. Further it was expected that there will be a reverse effect in the
positive valence condition. The appendix shows a simulation of the hypothesised
effects (see Figures \@ref(fig:plot-simulation-anecdotes-2-negative)
and \@ref(fig:plot-simulation-anecdotes-2-positive)). Therefore, Experiment 2
tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, three-way-anecdotes-2, name = "Overall effect", echo = TRUE}
Three-way interaction of similarity $\times$ valence $\times$ anecdote,
excluding statistics only
```

The main effect of interest was the moderation of anecdotal bias by similarity.
Therefore, as well as again testing
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1) for negative anecdotes,
Experiment 2 tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-2, name = "Anecdotal bias moderated by similarity for positive anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
For positive anecdotes, allocations will be higher in the statistics only
condition than in both the anecdote & statistics conditions (high and low
similarity). Within these two anecdote & statistics conditions, allocations will
be higher when the anecdote is similar than when it is dissimilar.
```

Contrary to both @wainberg2013 and Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:statistics-anecdotes-1),
Experiment 1 found that participants do somewhat integrate statistics in their
decisions. This effect was expected to replicate in Experiment 2. Therefore,
Experiment 2 tested the following:

``` {hypothesis, statistics-negative-anecdotes-2, name = "Effect of statistics for negative anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
For negative anecdotes, allocations will be higher for the high similarity
anecdote & statistics condition than for the high similarity anecdote only
condition.
```

``` {hypothesis, statistics-positive-anecdotes-2, name = "Effect of statistics for positive anecdotes", echo = TRUE}
For positive anecdotes, allocations will be higher for the high similarity
anecdote only condition than for the high similarity statistics & anecdote
condition.
```
