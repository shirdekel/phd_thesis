### Discussion

Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1)
and \@ref(hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-2) were supported, as participants
showed a stronger anecdotal bias effect when the anecdote was more similar to
the target project, for both positive and negative anecdotes. Further, as per
Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:statistics-negative-anecdotes-2)
and \@ref(hyp:statistics-positive-anecdotes-2), participants incorporated the
statistical information into their judgements, for both negative and positive
anecdotes.

Experiment 2 therefore found that, unlike in the medical domain, the effect of
anecdotes in financial decision-making does not depend on anecdote valence.
Further, as in Experiment 1, and unlike in @wainberg2013, the anecdotal bias
effect does not seem to be complete, with statistics still playing some role in
participants' decisions despite the effect of the anecdote.
