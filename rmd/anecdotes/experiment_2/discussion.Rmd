### Discussion

Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1)
and \@ref(hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-2) were supported, as participants
showed a stronger anecdotal bias effect when the anecdote was more similar to
the target project, for both positive and negative anecdotes. Further, as per
Hypotheses \@ref(hyp:statistics-negative-anecdotes-2)
and \@ref(hyp:statistics-positive-anecdotes-2), participants incorporated the
statistical information into their judgements, for both negative and positive
anecdotes. Unlike in Experiment 1, the relevance rating data did not provide as
clear indication that participants were using only the specific project
information rather than merely its industry.

Experiment 2 therefore found that, unlike in the medical domain, the effect of
anecdotes in financial decision-making does not depend on anecdote valence.
Further, as in Experiment 1, and unlike in @wainberg2013, the anecdotal bias
effect does not seem to be complete, with statistics still playing some role in
participants' decisions despite the effect of the anecdote.
