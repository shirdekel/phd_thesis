### Discussion

I found support for Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-1) and
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:anecdote-similarity-anecdotes-2), as participants showed a
stronger anecdotal bias effect when the anecdote was more similar to the target
project, both for positive and negative anecdotes. Further, as per
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:statistics-negative-anecdotes-2) and
Hypothesis \@ref(hyp:statistics-positive-anecdotes-2), I found that participants
seemed to incorporate the statistical information into their judgements, in both
negative and positive anecdotes.

Experiment 2 therefore found that, unlike in the medical domain, the effect of
anecdotes in financial decision-making does not seem to depend on anecdote
valence. Further, as in Experiment 1, and unlike @wainberg2013, the anecdotal
bias effect does not seem to be complete, with statistics still playing some
role in participants' decisions despite the effect of the anecdote.
