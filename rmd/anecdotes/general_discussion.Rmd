## General discussion

Most of the hypotheses were supported. This chapter found that, in a capital
allocation context, people's decisions are influenced by anecdotes even when
aggregated data are available. There were three novel findings: 1. the anecdotal
bias effect was only seen when participants considered the anecdote as
sufficiently relevant to the target project, 2. participants integrated
statistics in their decisions, and 3. these effects were found in both negative
and positive anecdotes.

The first novel finding from these experiments was that participants moderated
their use of anecdotal evidence. Specifically, when the anecdote appeared to be
causally relevant, participants used it in their decisions. However, when it
appeared irrelevant, participants relied on statistics almost entirely. The
findings in the high similarity condition are largely congruent with findings
from other work investigating anecdotal bias in business decision-making. As in
@wainberg2013 and @wainberg2018, this chapter found that people allocated less
capital to a project that is successful according to statistical evidence
co-presented with contradictory similar anecdote, than to a project with the
statistics alone.

It seems that participants made the distinction between the low and high
similarity conditions based on the underlying structure of the anecdote. The low
similarity condition always consisted of the same project type, for each domain,
as in the high similarity condition. For instance, in one variation, both the
high and low similarity anecdotes involved oil well projects. However, the high
similarity anecdotes also matched with the target project on a number of
specific features. This means that participants were sensitive to the specific
information presented to them in the anecdote description and analysis, and did
not simply use the project type for their inferences. Further, participants'
answers to the follow up questions indicated that they did not consider the
anecdote to be necessarily relevant to other projects from the same industry. In
other words, participants did not appear to carelessly use anecdotal evidence in
their decisions, but instead appeared to carefully consider the anecdote based
on its particular causal structure.

The second novel finding from these experiments was that participants that saw
the statistics with anecdotal evidence did not completely disregard the
statistical measures. @wainberg2013 found a complete effect of anecdotal bias,
because in their study the anecdote only and anecdote & statistics conditions
were equivalent. This meant that the statistics they provided had a negligible
effect on participants' decisions. The experiments in this chapter, on the other
hand, showed a partial anecdotal bias effect, seen as a difference in
allocations between the anecdote only and anecdote & statistics conditions. It
seems as if participants integrated the anecdotal information with the
statistical information. This suggests that people's evaluation of evidence
might be more sensitive than previously thought.

The discrepancy between these results and those in @wainberg2013 might be a
result of the sampled population. Since @freling2020 found a stronger effect of
anecdote when decisions were more personally relevant, the manager sample in
@wainberg2013 may have simply been more personally invested in the task than the
laypeople in the experiments in this chapter. Similarly, @yang2015 found that
anxiety increases anecdotal bias in risky choice. The discrepancy might also,
however, be due to the anecdote & statistics condition not being equivalent
between @wainberg2013 and the present work. Specifically, the statistics shown
in the anecdote & statistics condition in @wainberg2013 were not the same ones
that were shown in the same study's statistics only condition, unlike in both
the present experiments and @wainberg2018. Instead, it was the anecdote &
enhanced statistics condition that contained the same statistics as in the
statistics only condition. This suggests that people only integrate statistics
when they are sufficiently clear and no further interpretation is required.

The third novel finding from these experiments was that anecdotal bias was found
in both negative and positive anecdotes. Most studies in the literature
considered anecdotes that involve an example with negative consequences (a
*negative* anecdote). For instance, a medication that does not treat the
symptoms of an illness. However, there is not much work in the literature that
involves an anecdote with positive consequences (a *positive* anecdote).
@jaramillo2019 found an asymmetry in the effect of the anecdote, such that the
effect was stronger when a person in a description did not get better after a
medication (negative), compared to when they did get better (positive). The
present experiments found a more symmetrical effect, such that both the effects
of the moderated anecdotal bias and the influence of statistics were found in
both valence conditions.

The difference between the findings from this chapter and those from
@jaramillo2019 might be due to the negative anecdote in their experiment
representing a persistence in a negative shift from the status quo (of not being
sick). In the business domain, both the positive and negative anecdotes
represent shifts from the status quo (of the company's financial position).
Regardless, it is still surprising not to find an asymmetry because of the
predictions of prospect theory. Loss aversion suggests that participants would
have avoided the projects associated with the negative anecdotes more than they
would have chosen those associated with the positive anecdotes. On the other
hand, each choice was associated with the conflicting statistical information,
so this may cancel out the change from the reference point. Future research
should use more realistic incentives in order to investigate this effect
further. Doing this will also increase the ecological validity of the rest of
the findings.

### Theoretical implications

This chapter adds to the current understanding of the way people use different
forms of evidence in their decision-making. Previous work mostly investigated
the relative influence of statistics and anecdotes by comparing anecdote and
statistics conditions. The current work shows that comparing a joint anecdote &
statistics condition to both an anecdote only and statistics only condition
allows for a more specific representation of participants' anecdotal bias. The
influence of anecdote can be seen in the comparison between statistics only and
the anecdote & statistics condition, but the effect of statistics can be seen in
the comparison between the combined condition and the anecdote only condition.
These two effects allow to determine the independent influence of anecdote and
statistics, respectively. Further use of such a design in future research might
help to further understand the conditions under which these types of evidence
are used.

It seems that in some of the anecdotal bias literature there is an assumption
that using anecdotal evidence over statistical evidence is necessarily
irrational. This likely arises from examples from the medical domain in which
such decisions are indeed irrational (e.g., believing that vaccines cause
certain disorders despite the available evidence). In such cases, people
over-rely on anecdotes and should be relying more on aggregated data. However, a
case could be made for a rational use of anecdote based on the similarity of the
anecdote to the target. For instance, there are times in which an anecdote is so
similar to the target situation (e.g., the identical twin example discussed in
SectionÂ \@ref(effect-of-similarity)) that it would be unwise not to consider the
anecdote. That is, the use of anecdote should depend on both 1. the extent of
underlying structural similarity between it and the target problem, and 2. the
distribution of this similarity across cases in the sample from which the
anecdote was sampled. People should use an anecdote when casual structure is
significantly more relevant than other cases in available data.

However, similarity can also be misleading. For instance, if a case is highly
similar, but not along some key hidden dimension that is the real causal
mechanism to care about, then using the anecdote may be the wrong thing to do.
What seems to be important is a sensitivity to relational, rather than surface
level similarity. Future research should further investigate how varying the
assumptions that people have about sampling from a data set of anecdotes
influences their anecdotal bias. Such assumptions can include the size of the
sample and the shape of the distribution.
 
### Practical implications

The current work can contribute to managerial decision making by suggesting
insights into how managers make better decisions when using case studies and
statistical information. Managers of large companies are often in a difficult
position; they have incomplete information and an uncertain environment. Despite
this, different biases and responses to those biases can be anticipated for
different levels of uncertainty. For instance, a manager may be presented with
both a convincing case study that suggests a certain course of action, and
aggregated data. The manager needs to be able to weigh the evidence accordingly.

The work in this chapter suggests that there are three elements to consider: 1.
the quality of the aggregated data (determined by factors such as the sample
size), 2. the relative similarity of the cases in the data pool to the target
situation, and 3. the similarity of the anecdote to the target. For instance, if
the anecdote is relevantly similar to the target situation, and it is
significantly more similar than the rest of the cases in the data set, then it
should have more weight than an anecdote that comes from a pool of cases that
are all equally similar to the target. @lovallo2012 found that similarity
judgements increase prediction accuracy beyond a simple regression model. Taking
into account the relative similarity to other cases is likely to further
increase predictive validity.

In a situation in which aggregated data are not available, however, managers
should rely more on anecdotes that are more similar in causal structure. That
is, they should be wary of merely using the surface similarity to make
inferences, and instead consider the underlying relational structures. The
present data suggest that laypeople can do this to an extent, with participants
not being completely swayed by the mere similarity of the type of business
project. However, future research should investigate this further to better
understand the boundaries of people's analogical reasoning in capital allocation
decisions.
